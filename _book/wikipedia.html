<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Wikipedia</h1>
<p>Wikipedia is a non-conventional source of technical knowledge, with respect to patent and papers. With respect to the literature on field delineation and clustering applied to science and technology we innovate by introducing this new source. In particular in the present chapter, Wikipedia is proposed as tool to map a technological field. The process start with a small number of documents following a procedure which is <em>expert-independent</em>, in order to minimize the distortions from subjective judgment. We then exploit the properties of Wikipedia in order to delineate the field and identifying the linkages between technologies. Further description of the structure of Wikipedia can be found in section <a href="sotadocuments.html#sotadocumentswiki">5.3</a></p>
<p>In this section we present two methodologies capable of automatically use Wikipedia inforamtion and its structure with the aim of mapping and analysing this content. The results of the methodologies are described, togheter with example of applications of the extracted entities for intelligence tasks.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Industry 4.0: Extracting and Mapping Technologies</h2>
<p>Industry 4.0 is getting the center of the scene with respect to the future of production systems in advanced countries and to its economic and social implications. It is considered as the new fundamental paradigm shift in industrial production. The new paradigm is based on the advanced digitalization of factories, the Internet, and future-oriented technologies bringing intelligence in devices, machines, and systems <span class="citation">(Lasi et al. <a href="#ref-lasi2014industry">2014</a>)</span>. Despite its growing popularity and the great expectations in terms of innovation impact, the concept of Industry 4.0 remains strongly linked to technologies and frameworks that have been heavily researched and analyzed in the last decades. In particular, Industry 4.0 can be seen as a smart recombination of existing technologies and some new technologies and their application to the manufacturing environment <span class="citation">(Trappey et al. <a href="#ref-trappey2016review">2016</a>)</span>. This recombinant nature has led some authors to claim that it is nothing more than a re-labeling of old technologies, such as Computer Integrated Manufacturing <span class="citation">(Apreda et al. <a href="#ref-apreda2016functional">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Yet other authors claim that this new wave of technology is fundamentally different from previous technologies and not just an amalgamation. In order to address the question whether Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm, or rather a re-labeling of existing technologies, a preliminary activity is needed, namely the delineation of the field and the clustering of technologies covered in the perimeter. It turns out that this activity is extremely challenging in the case of Industry 4.0, for a number of reasons we discuss in great detail. Faced with the complexity of Industry 4.0 existing delineation and clustering methodologies can be considered inadequate.</p>
<p>In this paper we develop a novel approach, test it, and show its superior performance with respect to other approaches. The key features of the approach are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>the description of Industry 4.0 is offered in the form of an “enriched dictionary”, or an ordered and comprehensive collection of lemmas, each of which are associated to full scale definitions and descriptions and to explicit linkages to other lemmas;</p></li>
<li><p>the description of constituent technologies offered in the enriched dictionary is not obtained from individual experts, but is generated by accessing appropriate pages of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia;</p></li>
<li>the total number of technologies covered is more than 1200, linked with more than 39,000 semantic relations;</li>
<li><p>the perimeter of Industry 4.0 is not defined externally to the technology (by experts, government policies or other external sources) but is generated endogenously by examining the linkages between technologies described in the Wikipedia pages;</p></li>
<li><p>the update of the descriptions of technologies in the dictionary takes place in real time due to the distributed, parallel and selfcontrolled activities of authors in the worldwide community of contributors to Wikipedia;</p></li>
<li><p>new technologies are automatically included in the dictionary if they exhibit a given threshold of connectivity with those already included in the perimeter.</p></li>

<div id="industry-4.0-as-a-multi-technology-multi-stakeholder-field" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Industry 4.0 as a multi-technology multi-stakeholder field</h4>
<p>Industry 4.0 is the main keyword used by researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs when describing how worldwide industrial systems will evolve in the near future by leveraging Internet connected technologies to generate new added value for organizations and society <span class="citation">(Roblek, Meško, and Krapež <a href="#ref-roblek2016complex">2016</a>)</span>. The growing interest is confirmed by the increasing number of academic papers focusing on topics that are related to the so-called “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. As shown in Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:40trendscopus">8.1</a> the query “Industry 4.0” generates 967 papers. Even if the query is very sharp and does not include all the research efforts on the single “enabling technology” it demonstrates an exponential growth of the topic. In Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:40trendscopus">8.1</a> a projection represented by the dotted line is included. The projection has been drawn by considering a constant increase of the derivative calculated as the average of the last 4 years. Our forecast is that in 2017 there will be 575 new papers in Scopus; this estimate is supported by the fact that about 200 papers have been already published before June 2017 (represented by the point). Since previous analyses in Scopus demonstrate a delay between publication and loading of 5–6 months our forecast seems to confirm a growing interest on the topic.</p>

</div>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:tabletech40scopus"><strong>??</strong></a> shows how the scientific production on Industry 4.0 is divided among the main research fields (multiple attributions are possible in Scopus). In particular, it is possible to identify field specific-technologies that refers just to one or few sectors/business areas, and general purpose technologies that can be exploited in several sectors/business areas.</p>

<p>Formulated initially in Germany in 2011, the Industry 4.0 paradigm has been quickly translated, adapted and reinterpreted in developed and developing countries. Table (tabledocs40scopus) offers a compilation of official documents of governments, agencies and international organizations that in a few years after the initial formulation have embraced the concept.</p>

<p>Despite this rapid and impressive convergence of interest (in itself a clear demonstration of the interdependence of policies across the world), there is no common ground in the definition and delineation of the field even if a first definition of the goal of industry 4.0 have been presented since 1998 <span class="citation">(Council and others <a href="#ref-national1998visionary">1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>More precisely, while there is a reasonable convergence on the architectural definition of Industry 4.0, as defined in a relatively loose way, there is still considerable disagreement and misalignment with respect to constituent technologies <span class="citation">(Riel et al. <a href="#ref-riel2017integrated">2017</a>; Smit et al. <a href="#ref-smit2016industry">2016</a>; O’Halloran and Kvochko <a href="#ref-o2015industrial">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many constituent technologies are included in the definition of Industry 4.0, and hence described in these documents, from a variety of perspective that reflect mainly the huge variety of application domains. In other words, technologies are often described not only with respect to their fundamental engineering principles and related dimensions of performance, but with respect to specific applications to various manufacturing or service operations. In these applications the specific working of technologies and the associated dimensions of performance are indeed quite diverse.</p>
<p>Grangel and González <span class="citation">(Grangel-González et al. <a href="#ref-grangel2016towards">2016</a>)</span> develop a deductive rule-based system able to identify conflicts among AutomationML documents, named ALLIGATOR. It is interesting for the present work to notice how ALLIGATOR has the function to interoperate and align information models between a vast variety of areas (manufacturing, security, logistics) at a micro/plant level. In other words, this paper highlights the fact that one of the main problems of Industry 4.0 is the integration of models and concepts typically developed in their respective domains.</p>
<p>To offer an example of this state of affairs, let us consider the case of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification and Detection) technology. One of the main uses of RFID technology, that is, the detection of the location of a tag moving along a known path with known speed can indeed be applied for largely different purposes (safety, tracking, localisation) and in various company areas (production, logistics, maintenance). In practice, each of these applications will develop the basic technology in different directions. Depending on the applications we will find largely different descriptions of the technology involved. Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:techvaluechain40">8.2</a> offers a Value Chain-like representation of Industry 4.0, showing the wide range of applications of constituent technologies.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:techvaluechain40"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>An interesting consequence of this state of affairs is that there is disagreement also at the higher level of government documents describing Industry 4.0 as the main object for innovation and industrial policies: when describing the main components of Industry 4.0 the French government uses 47 technologies, against 39 technologies for the Italian government.</p>
<p>Summing up, the recombinant nature of Industry 4.0 creates several interrelated problems for profiling and mapping: - the number of constituent technologies is very large - the description and performance of constituent technologies depend critically on the specific application, hence on the business function/company area affected - the stakeholders are located in several organizational positions - the technical progress is very fast, with many (even if not all) constituent technologies facing rapid changes in their nature and performance.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, a traditional approach to profiling and mapping would require a massive effort of keyword definition. A number of experts would be recruited in order to offer a representation of the field from their disciplinary or industry perspective. Extensive domain knowledge would be mobilized in such a way to build up detailed yet comprehensive maps of technologies. Based on these maps, governments, statistical offices and international organizations would work for a few years in line in the effort to identify the trends of technologies, the most important actors, the shares of individual countries or regions in the global landscape. For sure, this is the approach underlying most of the documents illustrated in Table (tab:tabledocs40scopus) and this the approach that will be pursued in the years to come.</p>
<p>We strongly suggest this approach does not deliver the expected result. Keyword-based approaches to emerging technologies are too dependent on subjective judgments of experts. Even when the experts involved are top class and disinterested (often the best researchers or industrialists), their vision is inevitably partial. Even more importantly, keyword-based representations cannot be updated with the same speed of technology. The set of keywords identified by experts becomes inevitably obsolete in a few months. This paper leverages on publications and open source repositories to design, develop and test a methodology that provides delineation and clustering of technologies of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The methodology is based on a dictionary concerning the enabling technologies for industry 4.0 with full definitions and connections between them. Given the fast growth and the uncertainty that characterizes industry 4.0 technologies, the present methodology is designed to be a bottom-up and continuous evolving tool. The structure and measurements made on the tool refer to July 2017.</p>

<div id="mapping-and-clustering-a-complex-emerging-technology" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Mapping and Clustering a complex emerging technology</h4>
<p>The first task for mapping a new technology is field delineation, or the definition of the perimeter of the field. Industry 4.0 is not a new technology, but a novel combination of partly existing, partly new technologies driven by the convergence of their trajectories. As a matter of fact, it is clearly an example of emerging technology <span class="citation">(Rotolo, Hicks, and Martin <a href="#ref-rotolo2015emerging">2015</a>)</span>, as it shares the features of rapid growth, technological uncertainty, and market uncertainty.</p>
<p>The delineation of new fields of science and technology is an issue addressed since the late ‘70s, after the pioneering period of bibliometrics. Field delineation is a necessary step when existing classifications do not offer timely, reliable or comprehensive coverage of a topics, for example of a new technology or a new technological field. Moving beyond existing classifications require undertaking a search which, in general, may follow a lexical approach, a citationist approach, or a mix between the two <span class="citation">(Small <a href="#ref-small2006tracking">2006</a>; Kreuchauff and Korzinov <a href="#ref-kreuchauff2017patent">2017</a>)</span>. In all cases there is a need to initialize the process, i.e. to identify a set of elements that constitute the starting point for searching.</p>
<p>The main approach has been based on keywords, to be identified in various regions of documents (title, abstract, keywords, full text of an article; title, abstract, claims, full text of a patent) and to be used as queries. A query is a structured sequence of words, connected by logical elements, such as “or”, “and” and the like, to be launched on a database in order to build up profiling, indexing, or clustering a given field. In general the initial set of keywords are provided by experts in the field, usually organized in an expert panel.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of the keyword/expert approach. First, expert based keyword definition, or patent classification is a very expensive activity <span class="citation">(Tseng, Lin, and Lin <a href="#ref-tseng2007text">2007</a>)</span>. Second, the keyword selection is based on subjective judgment, and when experts are asked to decide on relatedness measures (e.g. synonims, hypernims or hyponims), they do not apply systematic rules <span class="citation">(Tseng, Lin, and Lin <a href="#ref-tseng2007text">2007</a>,<span class="citation">Noh, Jo, and Lee (<a href="#ref-noh2015keyword">2015</a>)</span>)</span>. Experts may be subject to a number of biases, such as for example the desirability bias (attributing higher probability of occurrence to preferred events) and many others (see section <a href="sotatools.html#sotadocumentsunderstandbyas">4.8.1</a>). Panels of experts are not immune by biases, such as group thinking. There is little research on the impact of expert subjective judgments on the delineation of emerging fields, but there is reason to believe it may be significant.</p>
<p>Third, the delineation of perimeter of emerging technologies is not robust to slight differences in the queries. As it has been shown by Zitt and Bassecoulard, little differences in the wording of queries, or on the time window, may end up in completely different sets of documents <span class="citation">(Zitt and Bassecoulard <a href="#ref-zitt2006delineating">2006</a>)</span>. Therefore there is no proof that the method is reliable.</p>
<p>Finally, and more problematic for the case of Industry 4.0, the methodology is static, as it is based on a fixed sets of words. This set can (and in practice often is) updated, but this introduces a delay in the process and does not deliver reliable results. Keeping updated a collection of keywords in a dynamic technological landscape is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>These limitations have become evident in the last two decades, after the efforts of many authors to produce reliable perimeters of the emerging field of Nanotechnology. The initial efforts have been based on a classical expert-based approach. Panel of experts provided lists of keywords that were transformed into database queries. Among them, a consulting company called Lux, the Fraunhofer ISI in Germany, and CWTS in the Netherlands were the most active. Most studies delivered largely different delineations <span class="citation">(Youtie, Shapira, and Porter <a href="#ref-youtie2008nanotechnology">2008</a>; Ghazinoory, Ameri, and Farnoodi <a href="#ref-ghazinoory2013application">2013</a>; Ozcan and Islam <a href="#ref-ozcan2017patent">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In turn, these limitations opened the way to massive efforts to reduce the dependence on experts and exploit systematically the new opportunities opened by text mining, following what has been called “full text based scientometrics” <span class="citation">(Boyack, Small, and Klavans <a href="#ref-boyack2013improving">2013</a>)</span>. Starting from the late ‘90 s several attempts have been made to apply text mining techniques to the patent corpus and the field is currently burgeoning <span class="citation">(Joung and Kim <a href="#ref-joung2017monitoring">2017</a>; Ozcan and Islam <a href="#ref-ozcan2017patent">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Summing up, the existing approaches to the delineation of emerging technologies, taken together, suffer from the following limitations: 1. dependence on expert judgment 2. lack of robustness to alternative definitions of the perimeter 3. delay in update of technologies (static approach) iv) lack of transparency in the modeling of technology.</p>
<p>We now turn to the second main task in text mining of technology documents, that is, <em>clustering</em>. Once the perimeter of the field is delineated, a task usually included in the mapping is clustering, or the creation of groups of entities in such a way to reduce the complexity of the representation. Within text mining the clustering of documents is based on various kinds of linkages that are considered a signal of similarity in topics (see section <a href="sotatools.html#sotatoolsmodelnetanal">4.5.4</a>). In general, linkages among documents can be generated by citations (citationbased clustering) or by the extraction of features in texts (text-based clustering) <span class="citation">(Leydesdorff and Hellsten <a href="#ref-leydesdorff2006measuring">2006</a>; Wang and Koopman <a href="#ref-wang2017clustering">2017</a>; Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson <a href="#ref-jaffe1993geographic">1993</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The most used approaches to clustering assume that members of a cluster:</p>
<p>– cite each other (citation analysis: <span class="citation">(Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson <a href="#ref-jaffe1993geographic">1993</a>; Moed <a href="#ref-moed2006citation">2006</a>; Verspagen <a href="#ref-verspagen2007mapping">2007</a>; Lee and Kim <a href="#ref-lee2017knowledge">2017</a>)</span>);</p>
<p>– share certain words (co-word analysis: <span class="citation">(Callon et al. <a href="#ref-callon1983translations">1983</a>; Rip and Courtial <a href="#ref-rip1984co">1984</a>; Leydesdroff <a href="#ref-leydesdroff1989words">1989</a>; Engelsman and Raan <a href="#ref-engelsman1994patent">1994</a>; Van Raan and Tijssen <a href="#ref-van1993neural">1993</a>; Yoon and Park <a href="#ref-yoon2004text">2004</a>)</span>);</p>
<p>– share a reference in their bibliography (bibliographic coupling: <span class="citation">(Glänzel and Czerwon <a href="#ref-glanzel1996new">1996</a>; Kuusi and Meyer <a href="#ref-kuusi2007anticipating">2007</a>)</span>);</p>
<p>– share the same sub-fields in a classification (co-subfield analysis:<span class="citation">(Chang, Wu, and Leu <a href="#ref-chang2009using">2009</a>)</span>);</p>
<p>– are cited by the same documents (co-citation analysis: <span class="citation">(Small <a href="#ref-small1973co">1973</a>; Small and Sweeney <a href="#ref-small1985clustering">1985</a>)</span>);</p>
<p>– are cited by the same authors (author co-citation analysis: <span class="citation">(White and Griffith <a href="#ref-white1981author">1981</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In the proposed methodology we exploit the hyperlink feature of Wikipedia in order to introduce a new approach to clustering. Hyperlinks are introduced by authors in order to establish a semantic linkage between the page and other pages. We exploit this feature as follows: members of the same cluster are those pages that share the hyperlinks to other pages, according to thresholds defined by an appropriate algorithm. Note that hyperlinks are only superficially similar to citations. The origin page “cites” another page by hyperlinking it, but in effect this linkage is not a citation (that is, a reference to a previous work) but a signal of semantic similarity, intended to guide the reader in the network of meanings. We suggest that the hyperlinks are similar to citations under some respect, but very different under some other respects. Like citations, hyperlinks are introduced in the text by authors and reflect intentionality. Unlike citations, they reflect semantic relations, not relations of credit assignment or tribute to scientific authority. Perhaps more importantly, citations are introduced only by the author(s) of a paper and remain unchanged after publication. Hyperlinks, on the contrary, are introduced also by subsequent readers of the Wikipedia page. If the introduction of hyperlinks is not considered appropriate by the community of contributors, as it may happen due to vandalism, they are immediately removed (see the discussion below). This means that they reflect all possible semantic connections among the pages, as collectively stated by a large community of authors, in a reliable and robust way. We believe this methodology offers a remarkable improvement with respect to existing approaches.</p>

<div id="how-is-similarity-measured-by-using-wikipedia" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>How is similarity measured by using Wikipedia</h4>
<p>In general, semantic relatedness is a measure of the similarity between two terms. It can be computed by statistical methods without requiring a manually encoded taxonomy, for example by analyzing term co-occurrence in a large corpus <span class="citation">(Resnik <a href="#ref-resnik1999semantic">1999</a>; Jiang and Conrath <a href="#ref-jiang1997semantic">1997</a>)</span>. Wikipedia has been largely exploited in the literature in order to compute semantic relatedness. Gabrilovich and Markovitch <span class="citation">(Gabrilovich and Markovitch <a href="#ref-gabrilovich2007computing">2007</a>)</span> developed an alternative to Latent Semantic Analysis and called this new technique Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA). This methodology first uses a classifier that is centroid-based to map input text to a vector of weighted Wikipedia articles. Then the vectors are exploited to obtain the semantic relatedness between two terms by computing the cosine similarity. This technique could be applicable to individual words, phrases or even entire documents. Furthermore, the mapping developed in this work has been successfully utilized for documents categorization. A new version of this kind of systems was presented by Milne <span class="citation">(Milne <a href="#ref-milne2007computing">2007</a>)</span>. While in Gabrilovich and Markovitch <span class="citation">(Gabrilovich and Markovitch <a href="#ref-gabrilovich2007computing">2007</a>)</span> the authors use the full text of Wikipedia articles to establish relatedness between terms, in this work only the internal hyperlinks are exploited. To compute the relatedness between two terms, they are first mapped to corresponding Wikipedia articles and then vectors are created containing the links to other Wikipedia articles that occur in these articles. The main problem facing semantic relatedness using Wikipedia is the disambiguation of terms. Several strategies have been developed to solve this problem. A first approach, described in Strube and Ponzetto <span class="citation">(Strube and Ponzetto <a href="#ref-strube2006wikirelate">2006</a>)</span>, exploits the order in which entries occur in the disambiguation pages of Wikipedia to find the most likely correct meaning. On the other hand, Gabrilovich and Markovitch <span class="citation">(Gabrilovich and Markovitch <a href="#ref-gabrilovich2007computing">2007</a>)</span> avoids disambiguation entirely by simultaneously associating a term with several Wikipedia articles. Milne <span class="citation">(Milne <a href="#ref-milne2007computing">2007</a>)</span> approach hinges upon correct mapping of terms to Wikipedia articles. However, when terms are manually disambiguated, it has been shown that the systems of semantic relatedness computation are more accurate than the systems of automatic disambiguation <span class="citation">(Medelyan et al. <a href="#ref-medelyan2009mining">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Summing up, a consistent literature in the field of computational linguistics and text mining supports the notion that the use of Wikipedia articles as a knowledge base is justified and promising.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>In this section we give evidence of the methodological steps undertaken to build up the enriched dictionary referred to Industry 4.0. The dictionary contains technologies related to the Industry 4.0 paradigm, each of which is associated to the full set of relations with other technologies. The dictionary is semi-automatically generated using technical documents and the Wikipedia free online encyclopedia. The linkages between technologies have all a semantic content, since they are generated within the text of the articles of Wikipedia when a related topic or entry is considered necessary for the logical flow of the definition or description.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:wf40">8.3</a> shows the methodological steps needed to generate the enriched dictionary. In the flow diagram three elements are graphically displayed: activities (rectangular shape), check points (diamond shape) and documents created from the procedure (sheet of paper shape).</p>

<div id="generation-of-the-seed-list" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Generation of the seed list</h4>
<p>As input for our methodology we used technical documents, official government documents and the most cited academic papers in the field of industry 4.0. The selection of seed documents has been made by:</p>
<p>– taking the official government documents of the US government and of three large European countries (France, Germany, UK), all of which are strongly committed to the support of Industry 4.0 and are widely considered a benchmark in international documents (for example, OECD and European Union), plus a selection of technical documents cited in government papers, for a total of 10 documents;</p>
<p>– taking the 10 most cited papers on Industry 4.0 according to Scopus. The reference to Industry 4.0 was explicit in the title, abstract and keywords of the papers. The extraction was made on Scopus Database in June 2017.</p>
<p>We deliberately limit ourselves to a small number of documents. The reason is explained in conjunction with the chosen stopping rules. The documents have been manually parsed by a team of Master students in Engineering Management at the University of Pisa. The assignment was “Understand each document and extract the enabling technologies for industry 4.0”. The manual search in the documents continued until the team reached the goal of 100 different technologies extracted. For our purposes 100 different technologies represents a reasonable seed list of technologies, which will be used as input for the automatic expansion phase. The chosen documents are shown in Table (tab:tabledocs40scopus).</p>
</div>
<div id="seed-list-expansion" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Seed list expansion</h4>
<p>For each term in the seed list the corresponding page in Wikipedia was found. All technologies identified in the seed were covered by Wikipedia. This is a preliminary confirmation of its relevance as a source of knowledge. These pages formed the initial glossary. The expansion procedure automatically retrieved the pages and identified all hyperlinks included in the description of the technology. The pages that are the target of hyperlinks are classified manually according to the following categorization:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>links to pages already in the seed: these pages are labeled “anchors”, since they provide robust indicators of technologies that are, at the same time, mentioned explicitly in the seed documents and referred to in Wikipedia pages that deal with other technologies;</li>
<li>links to pages not in the seed: these are labeled “missing technologies” and are stored in memory for later treatment as potential candidates to inclusion in the dictionary;</li>
<li>links to pages with non-technological content: they are labeled “stopwords” and are eliminated from the procedure. The overall procedure is iterated up to the point in which a number of at least 1000 different technologies is reached. At this point the procedure will stop. Updates and changes of the dictionary can originate from new entries (new technologies) or from updates to existing pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the automatic extraction of Wikipedia pages can be run on a permanent basis, each version of the dictionary has a date. The current version, illustrated in the rest of the paper, is at the time point of July 15, 2017.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-stopping-rule-for-the-manual-and-the-automatic-expansion" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The stopping rule for the manual and the automatic expansion</h4>
<p>The three stopping rules follow a sequential logic of order of mag- nitude: we start with approximately 101 documents, from which we extract 102 names of technologies, that, used as inputs to Wikipedia, deliver approximately 103 final technologies. More in detail we make use of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>20 input documents: all technical documents taken as reference for Industry 4.0 share the same framework (i.e. DIN:SPEC 91345:2106). Many of the documents contains the same informations/terms/ technologies. Furthermore these documents are technology focused and therefore from a low number of documents we obtain a large number of technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>seed list of 100 technologies: as demonstrated in the past Wikipedia is a good source also for technical terms, therefore we assumed it was able to quickly expand the technologies related to Industry 4.0. For this reason the seed list is composed of no more than 102 entries.</p></li>
<li><p>output list of at least 1000 technologies: of the automatic expansion works correctly the technologies should increase by an order of magnitude in few iterations. Since the list has to be revised manually we decided for 103 entries as a target thus reducing the impact of manual review. As a matter of fact, the Wikipedia network of semantic linkages delivers a total number of technologies related to Industry 4.0 which exceeds this target, again confirming the validity of Wikipedia as a source of knowledge.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="structure-of-the-enriched-dictionary" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Structure of the enriched dictionary</h4>
<p>The enriched dictionary can be defined as a set of enabling technologies for industry 4.0, associated to their definitions and to the linkages between them. The digital version of the tool is a hyperlinked text.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>For the purpose of publication in an academic paper the tool can be represented as a table in which we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Column 1- Technologies: Enabling technologies for industry 4.0, or a broad categorisation of technologies following a clustering procedure (see below)</li>
<li>Column 2- Url: Links of the Wikipedia pages of the enabling tech- nologies for industry 4.0</li>
<li>Column 3- Definitions: Glossary, snippets from wikipedia page of the definition of the enabling technologies for industry 4.0</li>
<li>Column 4 Links: hyperlinks to other wikipedia pages from the wi- kipedia pages of enabling technologies for industry 4.0</li>
<li>Column 5- Anchors: hyperlinks to other wikipedia pages that are enabling technologies for industry 4.0 from the wikipedia pages of enabling technologies for industry 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the table shown in figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:technimetrosample">8.4</a> shows a sample of the dictionary for four enabling technologies. An evidence is that there are conflicting definitions of “Augmented reality” (AR) and “Virtual reality” (VR); the first says that AR contrasts VR, while the second states that “AR systems may also be considered a form of VR”. This is an evidence of the ambiguity that exists in the definition of 4.0 technologies. Moreover, the table underlines how words such as “3D printing” and “Additive manufacturing” that are used in different ways within papers and technical documents (see Table 3), basically refer to the same concept. Table <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:technimetrosample">8.4</a> also shows the difference between links and anchors. Links include all hyperlinks found in Wikipedia pages. By nature, a certain fraction of these links contain information that is not relevant to our task. It is likely that, in the course of discussion of a given topics, authors quote an author (e.g. Bob Sproull in Virtual Reality), an institution (e.g. British Museum or California Institute of Technology) or an event or application (e.g. Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival). These links do not add to our knowledge of the Industry 4.0 field. It can be seen that, following the definition of anchor given above, these terms are eliminated in column (E), which includes only the anchors, or those entries that are added to the body of knowledge.</p>

<p>The dictionary is composed of 1.211 terms and 39.078 relationships between them. This generates a graph in which the node represents a technology and the edge represents a link in the Wikipedia page. The network structure naturally gives origin to graph-theoretic metrics. We exploit this property in order to generate a number of indicators that the readers may find it useful to examine.</p>
<div id="graph-analysis-and-sub-graph-selection" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Graph analysis and Sub-graph selection</h4>
<p>Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:techgraphplot1">8.5</a> gives an overview of the obtained. We compute for each node the in-degree (horizontal axis), the out-degree (vertical axis) and the number of links to other Wikipedia pages that each node has (color of the node). Our results show that in terms of the analyzed variables we can identify 4 different clusters of nodes (or technologies) each one having a different behaviour. The first group we take in consideration are the point having an indegree greater than 70 and an out-degree greater than 70. In this group on the top right of the page we have some outliers. These are terms like Microprocessor and Microcontroller, X86, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit. Then we observe a sub-group centered on the coordinates (150, 100). Here we have terms like Program counter, Adressing mode, Instruction Cycle, Coprocessor, Symultaneus multitrading, SISD and MISD. Still within the first cluster we have another sub-group of terms centered in (80,110) with terms like Intel i860, Intel Atom, Intel 80286, Intel 80188 but also Bloomfiled and Wolfdale. The second cluster is one in which the points have an in-degree greater than 70 and an out-degree smaller than 70. Here we have terms like Machine learning, Artificial Neural Network, Cognitive Computing, Software, Random Access Memory, Internet, Firmware and C++. The third group collects points having an in-degree lower than 70 and an out-degree greater than 70. Here we have terms like Processors, Micro-Operation, Micro-Assembler, Application specific integrated circuit. The last and most populated cluster has an in-degree smaller than 70 and an out degree smaller than 70.</p>

A jitter process has been implemented to the points on the graph in order to better visualize the overlapped points. In this plot only the technologies having both an in-degree and an outdegree lower than 70 are shown. This generates a subgraph composed by 931 nodes and 10673 edges.</p>

<h4>Graph representation and cluster analysis</h4>
<p>The structure of the graph offers it self naturally to clustering of technologies in order to obtain a readable mapping. The clustering algorithm receives as input the collection of technology terms T of the analyzed subgraph and returns a set of terms clusters C = {C1, C2,.., Cn} that cover the whole subgraph in analysis. Each cluster Ci is a subset of terms of T, and a term may belong to only one cluster. In Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:technimetro">8.7</a> we show a representation of the sub-graph made using Gephi software with its implementation of the Force Atlas algorithm <span class="citation">(Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy <a href="#ref-ICWSM09154">2009</a>)</span> . In this representation, two nodes in the graph are represented closely if they share an edge. In this way also nodes that belongs to the same communities of nodes (nodes that can be grouped into sets such that each set is densely connected internally) but do not share any edge are represented closely. In other words, the visualization tends to be coherent with the clustering algorithm. The size of the node is proportional to its in-degree while the colour express the cluster to which each node belong. Finally some of the labels of nodes and clusters are shown.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Industry 4.0: a Comparison with Industrie 4.0</h2>
<p>The Industry 4.0 paradygim can be understood and implemented differently in different industrial eco-systems, depending on the country in which it is adopted. In the present section we make use of Wikipedia to build a network of pages regarding industry 4.0 in such a way taht it is possible to map how a country is actually implementing the industry 4.0 paradigm. To analyze the differences between the industry 4.0 concept in the country of origin (Germany) and the rest of the world, our approach is thus to investigate the Wikipedia pages of Industrie 4.0 and Industry 4.0 and the pages they are connected to. Using clustering algorithm it is then possible to explore the different focus that countries have on different technological sub-field of Industry 4.0.</p>
<p>All aspects during our analyses and the description of the project, e.g. page names, consist of two parts: one in English and one in German. For simplicity and better understandability, we well mostly refer to everything only by the English name.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>In the present section we explain the methodology we adopted to build and analyze the two graphs of Wikipedia pages representing the concepts linked to industry 4.0 in Germany and in the rest of the world. As a proxy of the world-wide vision of industry 4.0 we analyzed the English version of Wikipedia. The main steps of our methods are represented in the workflow of figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:industriewf">8.9</a> The first step consisted of extracting all pages of interest from Wikipedia. Then the pages and their connections were used to build two graphs (the German and English version). The nodes of the graphs were then cleaned using a novel approach based on the categories of the Wikipedia pages. Finally a clustering algorithm was used to illustrate communities within the graph. These steps are described in the following sections.</p>

<h4>Wikipedia Pages Collection</h4>
<p>To list the pages connected to the concept of Industry 4.0, all Wikipedia pages that are linked to the page of Industry 4.0 (and Industrie 4.0) were downloaded. We will refer to these pages as level 1 connection. Then all the pages linked to the level 1 pages are collected and marked as level 2 pages. This process can be continued until a wanted level is reached: for the purposes of the present work we decided to show the effectiveness of the process stopping at level two. For each page, we collected the links to other pages and the categoriess of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id="graph-generation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Graph Generation</h4>
<p>Two pages that are linked by a link within Wikipedia shares a certain relations of which we ignore the meaning. Thus, it is possible that the approach we described until now, also collects pages that are not relevant for the analysis. In our case, this means that some of the extracted pages are not technologically related to the subject of Industry 4.0. Thus, the list of entries had to be cleaned from these non-relevant ones. To make the filtering process more efficient, we filtered considering the categories that had been extracted together with the pages. We considered as relevant all the categories of the pages of level 1. Then the level 2 pages were automatically considered to be relevant if they were in one of the formerly marked categories. For the nodes selection we also used a black-list of non-relevant Wikipedia pages (e.g. International Standard Name Identifier, International Standard Book Number, Digital object identifier, ISBN), previously developed by the authors in (see chapter <a href="wikipedia.html#technimetrochap">8.1</a>).

<h4>Clustering</h4>
<p>In order to identify macro topics in the formerly created graphs, we applied clustering methods.

<p>The dimension of the graphs in terms of nodes, links and categories are shown in Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:graphmetricsindustrie">8.10</a>. From this figure is evident how the two graphs has almost the same number of nodes; by the way, the mean number of categories for the German version is close to 0.5 while its 0.3 for the English version. Beside these measure, as it would be even more evident from further analysis, there is the broader approach to industry 4.0 in the rest world with respect to the more focused vision that Germany has.</p>

<h4>Graph metrics</h4>
<p>In this section we analyze the graphs using standard metrics. These measures allow investigations about relevant topology and specific features of a given graph. More precisely, we looked at the following measures: - Graph diameter: calculates the longest shortest path in a graph, thus, the minimal distance between two nodes that are the furthest away from each other. - Nodes Degree: Shows the number of nodes that every node is connected to. The mean value of the degree for the whole graph shows how interconnected the graph is: the higher the value, the more connections the nodes have with each other. - Nodes Distance: Gives back the minimum number of edges that connect one node with each other. Here again, the mean value shows the interconnectivity of the graph: A lower value means that the way from one node to another is shorter, thus that the graph is more highly connected. The results of these metrics for the two graphs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>German Version: Diameter= 4, Mean Degree= 2.38, Mean Distance= 3.25</p></li>
<li><p>English Version: Diameter= 4, Mean Degree= 3.29, Mean Distance= 3</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From the diameter measure we can see that all of the pages are connected through a maximum of 4 edges. This is not surprising, since it was a premise of the method when setting the level to 2. Considering the mean degree, a level of 2.38 for the German version and 3.29 for the English version shows how the nodes of the English graph are more interconnected. This can also be qualitative observed when looking at the figures 3. Finally, the average distance from one node to another is higher in the German graph, supporting the finding of the measures discussed above.</p>
<p>These findings goes in line with what is said by a study of Acatech <span class="citation">(Kagermann <a href="#ref-kagermann2006industry">2006</a>)</span>: in the USA, for example, the term Industry 4.0 is understood in a much wider meaning. Furthermore, Acatech study say that in Germany, the focus is mostly on technological dimensions, while in the USA, the development of the new business models in the area of big data analytics play a greater role, among others.</p>

<div id="clustering-1" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Clustering</h4>
<p>Figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:industrieclusters">8.12</a> shows the outcomes of the clustering process: the vertices of the graphs represent the Wikipedia pages, the links are depicted by arcs that are directed from the originating page to the linked page and the clusters are represented by the different colors of the nodes. In order to make these clusters comparable, the label of the German version are translated in English. The resulting, corresponding groups as well as the number of nodes they contain can be found in table <a href="wikipedia.html#tab:industrietab3">8.1</a>.</p>
<p>Considering together figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:industrieclusters">8.12</a> and table <a href="wikipedia.html#tab:industrietab3">8.1</a>, it is evident how the central node of the graph (Industry 4.0) is contained in the first cluster Internet of things &amp; manufacturing for both the graphs. It is also by design connected to all other clusters, so that no cluster is isolated from Industry 4.0 node.</p>
<p>As evident from table <a href="wikipedia.html#tab:industrietab3">8.1</a>, the clusters in the two graphs are similar. We have the same five clusters in both graphs and a different one for each language. This shows that Industry 4.0 framework if considered at a more abstract level, is similar in different countries. This is not surprising, since there must be something that made policy and industry call it the same name, but it is a strong result for our methods, able to map bottom-up this phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, when looking at the clusters more closely, some interesting differences get clear. The cluster production, product life circle &amp; flow production, which is completely missing in the English graph, is the one with the higher number of nodes in the German one. This shows how the topic of Industry 4.0 in Germany is much more concentrated on production than elsewhere. In the study of acatech <span class="citation">(Kagermann <a href="#ref-kagermann2006industry">2006</a>)</span>, it is also explicitly stated that in Germany “ […] the focus is on optimizing production processes in terms of quality, price and flexibility and delivering better financial returns overall”. The focus on production for Germany is also confirmed by a monitor paper written by the by the European Commission <span class="citation">(Comission <a href="#ref-industrie2016eu">2016</a>)</span>. To give a clearer view of this phenomena, we have to consider that the word production is very similar in meaning to manufacturing. The cluster including the latter (internet of things &amp; manufacturing) has more than the double number of nodes in the English graph with respect to the German one, so it might be that it is rather the wording that makes the difference. Anyway, by looking at the the disposition of the cluster (see figure <a href="wikipedia.html#fig:industrieclusters">8.12</a>) internet of things &amp; manufacturing in the two graphs, it can be observed that in the English version the cluster is strongly integrated with ITC-related topics (Data processing &amp; Analytics, Cognition and Cloud Computing), adding the adjective cyber to the topic of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Additionally, also automation has more entries in the English version and is highly connected not only to internet of things &amp; manufacturing, but also to could computing, which does not even exist in the German version of the graph: it is well known that Germany is not at the front when it comes to the integration of ICT in Industry 4.0. This found is again confirmed by the study of Acatech <span class="citation">(Kagermann <a href="#ref-kagermann2006industry">2006</a>)</span>, where it is said that “Germany is currently lagging behind with regard to data-driven business models and the development of large platform ecosystems”.</p>
<p>The fact that cloud computing does not show up in the German graph is examined more closely. In fact, a Wikipedia page about this topic does exist in the German version of Wikipedia, but is not linked to the Industrie 4.0 page. As stated in section 4.3, contributors of the German version of Wikipedia tend to add only the most important connections between pages. This again shows that integrated ICT is not the most important topic in Germany now.</p>
<p>Another great difference in the number of nodes is in the cluster cognition, which seems to be more important in the German version of the graph. The German Wikipedia page describes this as a processing and rearrangement of information between a human and a system. Acatech study <span class="citation">(Kagermann <a href="#ref-kagermann2006industry">2006</a>)</span> does the same observation: “In Germany in particular, the focus is on integrating information, communication and manufacturing technologies”. This could explain even better the finding that the German graph lacks on the ICT side, giving a new interpretation: in Germany there is a different interpretation of the meaning of cognitive computing with respect to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Finally, while the group of data, processing and analytics nearly has the same amount of nodes, the links of this cluster with the other clusters is quite different in the two graphs and also its content changes from on nation to the other. Words like big data does not even exist in the list of German pages related to industry 4.0 where it is limited to just data. This emphasizes the careful approach of Germany with this topic, which was also observed in <span class="citation">(Wee et al. <a href="#ref-wee2015industry">2015</a>)</span>. Germany seems to be rather conservative when it comes to new emerging technological trends or even buzz-worlds like Big Data.</p>
