<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Patents</h1>
<p>Patents contain a large quantity of information which is usually neglected. This information is hidden beneath technical and juridical jargon and therefore so many potential readers cannot take advantage of it. State of the art natural language processing tools and in particular named entity recognition tools, could be used to detect valuable concepts in patent documents. A deeper description of what patents are and how these documents are used to mine technical knowledge can be found in section <a href="sotadocuments.html#sotadocumentspatents">8.1</a></p>
<p>In this section we present three methodologies capable of automatically detecting and extracting threee of the multiple entities hidden in patents: the users of the invention, advantages and drawbacks of the invention and trademarks contained in patents. The results of the methodologies are described, togheter with example of applications of the extracted entities for intelligence tasks.</p>
<div id="usersresults" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Users</h2>
<p>Patents are documents that must provide a detailed public disclosure of an invention <span class="citation">(Idris <a href="#ref-wipo2">2008</a>)</span>. An <em>invention</em> is a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The notion of usefulness implies that the invention must have some value and not necessarily for a human entity. In fact, patents usually describe processes, machines or composition of matter which are useful for another process, machine or composition of matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, we distinguish between stakeholders and users, considering the definitions given by the authors in <span class="citation">(Bonaccorsi and D’amico <a href="#ref-bonam2017">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Definition 1: <strong>Stakeholder</strong> : <em>Stakeholders are entities on which the invention has or will have a positive or negative effect in order to show usefulness.</em></p>
<p>This definition covers all possible entities that engage an active or passive relation with the invention.Given the logical condition of usefulness of patents, all patents must have stakeholder information. If a patent has not got any stakeholder information in it the patent application should be rejected.</p>
<p>Definition 2: <strong>User</strong>: <em>Users are animated or previously animated entities (human or animal, alive or dead), on which the invention has a positive or negative effect at an unspecified moment.</em></p>
<p>Given definition 2, it is clear that every user is a stakeholder while non-users stakeholders include artifacts, machines, manufacturing or operational processes.</p>
<p>Corollary 1: <strong>Multiple roles</strong>: <em>Identities may have multiple roles as users.</em></p>
<p>Our idea of users describes roles, not identities. Animated entities have an identity, as it happens for a specific person. A person has many roles as a user. For example, a <em>working mother</em> starts her day taking on the role of a <em>mom</em>, in which she is expected to feed her children and get them ready for school. At the office she shifts to the role of <em>project manager</em>, so she oversees projects in a timely and professional manner. <em>Working mother</em>, <em>mom</em> or <em>project manager</em> can be considered user roles attributed to the same person, or identity. From this definition it is clear that users are close to what social sciences define as “social roles”.</p>
<p>Afterward, we can outline knowledge fields using the concept of user, with a twofold aim: help the reader to understand how the concept of users is interpreted in different knowledge fields; explain the background of the methodology we adopted.</p>
<div id="social-sciences-social-roles-as-users" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Social sciences: social roles as users</h4>
<p>In social sciences <em>social roles</em> are comparable with our definition of user. As defined in the psychological field <span class="citation">(Dog <a href="#ref-alleydog">2015</a>)</span>, <em>“social roles refer to the expectations, responsibilities and behaviors we adopt in certain situations.”</em>. The example of the working mother shown before, is the case of social roles.</p>
<p>The field of social sciences is the only one in which an attempt of automatic extraction of users has been done. In <span class="citation">(Beller et al. <a href="#ref-belieber">2014</a>)</span> the authors extracted social roles from Twitter using heuristic methods. The authors looked for all the words preceded by constructions like “I’m a” and similar variations. This search resulted in 63.858 unique roles identified, 44.260 of which appeared only once. The result of the extraction process is noisy and only a low percentage of the extracted words are social roles. Despite of this noisy extraction, some entities are consistent with our definition of user, e.g. <em>doctor, teacher</em>, <em>mother</em> or <em>christian</em>.</p>
<p>Another work <span class="citation">(Beller, Harman, and Van Durme <a href="#ref-prefine">2014</a>)</span> tries to identify social roles on Twitter exploiting a set of assumptions. The authors take into account roles, each one with a set of related verbs: if someone uses verbs from a set, that person may cover that particular social role. To sanitize the collection of positively identified users, the authors crowd-sourced a manual verification procedure, using the Mechanical Turk platform <span class="citation">(Kittur, Chi, and Suh <a href="#ref-kittur2008crowdsourcing">2008</a>)</span>. Also here some interesting extractions are performed, obtaining users like <em>artist, athlete, blogger, cheerleader, christian, DJ</em>, or <em>filmmaker</em>. These two works differ from the present study for what concerns the analyzed texts and the methods to extract the entities. Nevertheless, the extracted set of entities is consistent with our definition of user.</p>

<div id="human-resources-management-workers-as-users" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Human Resources Management: workers as users</h4>
<p>In organizations, Human Resources Management is the function designed to maximize employees performance <span class="citation">(Johnson <a href="#ref-HRM">2009</a>)</span>. Employees are key actors and they can be considered users according to our definition.</p>
<p>Human Resources Management has tried to classify employees, especially in sub-fields like insurance, social security or work psychology. Usually, we refer to those as lists of jobs. Classifications were made with the goal of grouping similar jobs for educational requirements, job outlooks, salary ranges or work environments to facilitate social analysis and the placement of new workers. Such lists are relevant because, even if they represent just one subset of all the possible users, they contain valid information. Many institutions developed lists of jobs <span class="citation">(“Suffix Codes for Jobs Defined in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, Third Edition” <a href="#ref-listjobs">1967</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="medicine-patients-as-users" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Medicine: patients as users</h4>
<p>Another field of interest is medicine, since patients can be considered users. Also in this case there are many lists of patients, illnesses and diseases <span class="citation">(Health and Services <a href="#ref-cdcdiseases">2018</a>)</span>, which are valuable in terms of information contained.</p>
</div>
<div id="design-and-marketing-between-users-and-customers" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Design and Marketing: between users and customers</h4>
<p>In the field of <em>Design</em> the concept of user plays a central role and it overlaps with our definition of user. Many tools and theories like “User Centered Design” are based on the concept of user <span class="citation">(ISO <a href="#ref-ucd">1999</a>)</span>. As stated by the authors in <span class="citation">(K. <a href="#ref-npdul">2008</a>)</span>, the quality of the design process is proportional to the user needs’ satisfaction. It implies that a designer has to understand the user needs; as a consequence he has to discover whom are potential users.</p>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.1</span> Method</h3>
<p>In this section we show the approach used to extract the users of the invention described in a patent. The proposed process is shown in figure <a href="patents.html#fig:procesuser">9.1</a> and its phases are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Generation of an input list of users</em>: search all possible sources with the aim of creating an input list of users with the largest possible coverage (section <a href="#sourc"><strong>??</strong></a>);</p></li>
<li><p><em>Patent set selection</em>: select the set of documents from which extract the users (section <a href="#patsel"><strong>??</strong></a>);</p></li>
<li><p><em>Patent text pre-processing</em>: application of natural language processing tools on the documents with the aim of preparing them for the automatic user extraction;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Automatic patent set annotation 1</em>: projection of the input list of users on the text to generate the Automatically Annotated Patent Set 1;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Relevant sentences extraction</em>: selection of sentences containing at least one user to generate an informative training set;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Automatic patent set annotation 2</em>: generation of a statistical model by a machine learning algorithm based on the training set sentences and automatically tagging the patent set to generate the Automatically Annotated Patent Set 2;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Difference computation</em>: generation of the new list of users by computing the difference between the lists of users found in the automatically annotated patent set 1 and 2;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Manual review</em>: manual selection of the entities that, in the new list of users, are effectively users. This new list will enrich the original list of users. This phase is described in section <a href="#manrev"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p></li>

</p>
</div>
<p>Before the description of each phases, in section <a href="#userdef"><strong>??</strong></a> the concept of <em>user of the invetion</em> is explained by giving a definition of users and presenting the way that this concept is exploited in different knowledge fields.</p>
<div id="list-of-users-generation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>List of users generation</h4>
<p>To generate the input list of users, we used two different approaches: a bottom-up approach and a top-down approach. The bottom-up approach is based on the merge of lists from heterogeneous sources. In the present work we used the following lists of entities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lists of jobs</em> :<span class="citation">(“Suffix Codes for Jobs Defined in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, Third Edition” <a href="#ref-listjobs">1967</a>)</span>, 11.142 entities</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lists of sports and hobbies</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>: 9.660 entities;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>List of animals</em>:<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> 600 entities;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lists of patients</em>:<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> 14.609 users;</p></li>
<li><p><em>List of generic words</em>: manually generated. It contains users with a higher level of abstraction (such as <em>person</em> or <em>human being</em>), 56 items.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom-up approach produced a list of 35.767 entries.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a top-down approach was applied. Starting from the list generated with the bottom-up approach, we looked for alternative methods to indicate a user, finding defined word patterns. The most relevant are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns like “hobby_term + practitioner” for the hobbies;</li>
<li>Patterns like “person who has + disease_term” or “suffering from + disease_term” for the diseases;</li>
<li>Patterns like “practitioner of + sport_term” for sports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top-down approach generated a total of 41.090 entries.</p>
<p>The whole process generated a total of 76.857 users and gave us a reasonable number of terms to be used in the next step of the process.</p>
<p>Obviously our lists have a limited coverage and, therefore, they do not contain all variations of a certain user. For instance, the lists miss some users belonging to the classes mentioned above (e.g. new jobs emerged in the last years) and all the alternative ways for referring to a user we do not spotted in the top-down approach. For example our lists miss jobs like <em>data analyst</em>, <em>lap dancer</em>, <em>undertaker</em>, <em>mortician</em> and <em>thief</em> or patients with emerging diseases like <em>work-alcoholic</em> and <em>web-addicted</em>. In addition, our lists miss a class of users related to religious groups, containing users like <em>christians</em> or <em>jewish</em>. Such terms have intentionally <strong>not</strong> been introduced in the input list because we considered these terms as candidates to be extracted by the process in our case study .</p>
</div>
<div id="patent-set-selection" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Patent set selection</h4>
<p>Our choice of patent sets aimed at challenging our system to find new users missing in the input list. To reproduce a patent set selection, we took into consideration the International Patent Classification (IPC) <span class="citation">(Organization <a href="#ref-wipo1">1971</a>)</span>. IPC is a hierarchical system of patent classes representing different areas of technology. Then, we wondered which classes could contain new users according to our seed list. Furthermore, IPC class A, which is the first level in IPC differentiation, is based on human necessities. For this reason, we assumed that in this class we would have found likely users from patents texts.</p>
</div>
<div id="patent-text-analysis" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Patent text analysis</h4>
<p>Our Entity Extraction system is composed by a set of sequential phases. The first three phases are related to the linguistic annotation: sentence splitting and tokenization, part of speech tagging and lemmatization. Then, the patent set is analyzed by the entity extractor, specialized for users extraction. A more detailed description of each phase is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sentence splitting and Tokenization: These processes split the text into sentences and then segment each sentence in orthographic units called tokens. In our system, sentence splitting plays a key role since thanks to a given word, it is possible to find sentences where the word is used. Finding correct boundaries for a specific word allows to dramatically reduce the space to retrieve its surrounding contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>POS tagging and Lemmatization: The Part-Of-Speech tagging (or POS tagging) is the process of assigning unambiguous grammatical categories to words in context. It plays a key role in NLP and in many language technology systems. For the present application we used the most recent version of the Felice-POS-tagger described in <span class="citation">(Dell’Orletta <a href="#ref-dell2009ensemble">2009</a>)</span>. Once the computation of the POS-tagged text is completed, the text is lemmatized according to the result of this analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Semi-automatic Users Annotation: The Users Extraction tool is based on supervised methods. Such methods require an entity annotated corpus in order to extract new entities from unseen documents. A semi-automatic method has been used to generate an annotated corpus of users to avoid manual annotation of a patent set. The method is a projection of the list of users on the patent set defined in section @ref{patsel}. The list of users described in section @ref{sourc} is cleaned to avoid linguistic ambiguities when projecting these entities on the corpus. For example, the term <em>“guide”</em> has two different meanings when used as a verb or as a noun. Furthermore, as a noun it could indicate a component of a system (guide for mechanical parts) or a person (someone employed to conduct others) and therefore a user. Avoiding ambiguities is a crucial aspect to produce an informative training set, so ambiguous words were pruned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The entity annotation schema for a single token is defined using a widely accepted BIO annotation scheme :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B-USE</strong>: the token is the beginning of an entity representing an User;</li>
<li><strong>I-USE</strong>: the token is the continuation of a sequence of tokens representing an User;</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>: for all the other cases.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="user-entity-extraction" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>User Entity Extraction</h4>
<p>The Users extraction problem is tackled by the implementation of a supervised classifier that is trained on an annotated patent set. Thus, the patent set is linguistically-annotated, using the steps described above and entity-annotated, exploiting the semiautomatic annotation process executed in the previous steps.</p>
<p>Given a set of features the classifier trains a statistical model using the feature statistics extracted from the corpus. For each new document the trained model assigns to each word the probability of belonging to one of the classes previously defined (B-USE, I-USE, O).</p>
<p>In our experiments the classifier has been trained using two different learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the LIBSVM library <span class="citation">(Hearst, Dumais, Osman, et al. <a href="#ref-svm">1998</a>)</span> configured to use a linear kernel and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) implemented using the Keras library <span class="citation">(Chollet <a href="#ref-libkeras">2015</a>)</span>. It has been proven that LSTM methods are well suited for similar NER task. Anyway, we chose SVM and MLP method to study how two wheel established state of the art classifiers perform on the specific task of user extraction from patents and to evaluate their performance in terms of precision and computational effort. We also think that the popularity of these methods increment the reproducibility of the work.</p>
<p>The classifier uses different kind of features extracted from the text:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>linguistic features</em>, i.e. lemma, Part-Of-Speech, prefix and suffix of the analyzed token;</p></li>
<li><p><em>contextual features</em>, the linguistic characteristics of the context words of the analyzed token; in addition the entity category of the previous token is considered;</p></li>
<li><p><em>compositional features</em>, combinations of contextual features and linguistic features. i.e. Part-Of-Speech of the previous word and the lemma of the current word. These extra features allow to infer statistics on the interaction of the combined features that can not be captured by a linear SVM model.</p></li>
<li><p><em>word2vec features</em>: vector representations of words computed by the <em>word2vec</em> <span class="citation">(Mikolov et al. <a href="#ref-word2vec1">2013</a>)</span> tool.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Word2vec</em> is a NLP tool able to produce word representations exploiting big corpora. The main property of the vectors produced by <em>word2vec</em> is that words sharing similar contexts have similar vector representations. By using word vectors instead of the corresponding words we were able overcome the problem of the limited lexical knowledge in the training phase. Using these features and excluding all the others (delexicalized model) we expected that the resulting user extraction system had a lower precision and an higher recall in the classification phase. We presumed to find new users not contained in the input seed list.</p>
</div>
<div id="manual-review-of-the-new-list-of-users" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Manual Review of the new list of users</h4>
<p>It is still possible that the classification process creates false positive results (words labeled as users that do not match the definition in section @ref{theuse}). Thus, it is necessary to make a manual review of the extracted entities with the aim of evaluating the output.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.2</span> Results</h3>
<p>The following section describes the performances of the automatic users extraction process on two different patent sets. To test the system four experiments were conducted}. Finally the performances and the outcomes of the system are shown and discussed.</p>
<p>Following the guidelines for the patent set selection described in section , we examined two patent sets belonging to the IPC class A:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A47G33</strong>. The IPC definition of the subclass is <em>“religious or ritual equipment in dwelling or for general”</em>.</li>
<li><strong>A61G1-A61G13</strong>. The IPC definition of the subclass A61G1 is <em>“Stretchers”</em> while the definition of the subclass A61G13 is <em>“Operating tables; Auxiliary appliances therefor”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We extracted from the private Errequadro s.r.l.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> database a random sample of 2.000 patents from each IPC class. For each patent set we applied the semiautomatic set annotation process by projecting the input list of users on the morphosyntactically analyzed patent set. After this process, each semi-automatically annotated patent set was split in two parts: the first was used as training set for the user extractor, and the second one was used as test set.</p>
<p>To build an informative training set, from the semi-automatically patent set we selected a subset of sentences containing at least one user. The size of the training set in both cases is approximately composed by 600.000 tokens. For each patent set table <a href="patents.html#tab:patentsetdetails">9.1</a> shows the number of sentences of the training set, the number of sentences of the test set, and the number of distinct users in the training set (re-projected by the semi-automatic annotation process).</p>

<p>We chose two orders of magnitude for the sentences test-set to test the efficiency of multiple configurations of the system.</p>
<p>To test the performances of the implemented user extractor, we devised four different configurations. Each configuration uses a specific learning algorithm and a set of features to build the statistical model. The main purpose of this procedure is to find the configurations that better perform in the user extraction task. In addition, the different behaviour of the system in the classification phase is studied. In table <a href="patents.html#tab:feat-confs">9.2</a> are reported the detailed configurations used in our experiments.</p>

</table>
<p>By using the first and the second configuration we expected to have a higher precision in the classification phase, since explicit lexical information is used in the training phase. For the same reason we expected to have low recall in classification phase. On the other hand, the third and fourth configurations are delexicalized: lexical information is provided by word vectors computed by word2vec_. In these two configurations we expected to have an higher recall and a lower precision, due to the characteristics of the computed vectors explained before. To limit errors when using the <em>word2vec</em> features, some linguistically motivated filtering rules were introduced. Specifically, sequences of tokens classified as users were constrained from the following categories: verbs, adjectives not preceded by articles, articles and adverbs.</p>
<p>To evaluate the whole user extraction process in each experiment, we defined some evaluation measures. Each measure was introduced to evaluate the characteristics of the extraction system concerning the configuration applied.</p>
<p>These measures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training time: time needed to create the statistical model using the training set;</li>
<li>Test time: time needed to re-annotate the semi-automatically annotated patent set;</li>
<li>Number of extracted users: number of unique entities classified as user in the automatically annotated patent set;</li>
<li>Number of known users: number of distinct extracted users in the automatically annotated patent set and belonging to the list of user in input;</li>
<li>Number of new users: number of distinct entities classified as user in the automatically annotated patent set and not belonging to the input list of users;</li>
<li>Number of new correct users: number of distinct entities considered as user and as correct after a manual review;</li>
<li>Precision: ratio between the number of new distinct correct users and the total number of new distinct users;</li>
<li>Gain: ratio between the number of new distinct correct users and the number of re-projected distinct users on the training set.</li>

<p>For what concerns training and test time of the automatic patent set annotation, it’s clear that the configuration based on the SVM learning algorithm without the <em>word2vec</em> features performs better in both the experiments (1, 5). When the features based on <em>word2vec</em> are introduced, the configuration based on the MLP learning algorithm is the fastest both in training and test time (3, 6): it is due to the fact that keras implementation of this algorithm exploits all the available CPU cores of the system. On the other side, the MLP algorithm does not scale properly with a higher number of features, as seen in training and annotation time in the experiment (2). In addition, we could not perform the patent set annotation in the experiment (6), since it would have required more than 60 machine days to complete the process. When <em>word2vec</em> features are introduced, the patent set annotation based on the SVM algorithm is 10 times slower than the MLP algorithm.</p>
<p>For what concerns the precision in the automatic patent set annotation, the SVM configuration without <em>word2vec</em> features is clearly the more reliable: the precision values are from 1.5 to 2 times higher in the experiments (1, 5) in contrast to the other experiments. The higher precision is justified by the fact that the configurations based on <em>word2vec</em> features lack explicit lexical information: words with very similar contexts are represented by similar <em>word2vec</em> vectors, probably leading to errors in the classification phase. On the other hand, the use of <em>word2vec</em> vectors aims at extracting entities that would not be extracted by considering explicit lexical information only.</p>
<p>Finally, for what concerns information gain, the same amount of new information (21-37%) is extracted in the experiments on the A47G33 patent set. The gain values drastically change in the experiments on the A61G1-A61G13 patent set: in the experiments (5, 8) a gain between 61% and 72% is obtained: it is due to the size of this patent set in comparison to the A47G33 one. In the experiment (7), despite the introduction of <em>word2vec</em> features, a gain of 36% is obtained. This fact, in conjunction with the non-feasibility of the experimental configuration 6, shows how MLP systems lack in efficacy and efficiency (in entity extraction in patent domain) when the test-set has an order of magnitude of millions of sentences. We think that this result is relevant, based on our experience with practical applications.</p>
<p>Furthremore, a way to maximize the overall informative gain is to merge the results of all manually reviewed user extractions obtained by executing the patent set annotation process with all possible configurations.</p>
<p>The overall informative gain of the merging process is related to intersections that occur among the results obtained by the patent set annotation process in each configuration: the less the intersections, the more the overall informative gain obtained. In table <a href="patents.html#tab:mergedata">9.4</a> is shown the overall gain obtained by merging results of the manually reviewed extractions in each patent set.</p>

<p>The table shows that the merging process of manually reviewed entities extracted from each patent set annotation run effectively contributes to increase the overall informative gain. For instance in the A47G33 patent set an overall gain of 103.17% is obtained, tripling the best result achieved by the extraction performed using the best single configuration. Good results are also achieved in the A47G33 patent set user extraction. In this case an overall gain of 140.49% is obtained, doubling the best result achieved by the extraction performed using the best single configuration.</p>
<p>The results shown in section 5 prove that if the goal of the extraction is to reach the maximal recall, an ensemble method (combining the output of multiple classifier) over-performs every single classifier method. Anyway, the ensemble approach has clear efficiency issues, because the time of analysis will be the sum of every single approach time (in hypotheses of non-parallelization). This leads to a trade off between the speed of the system and the quality of the results, and whoever would use the presented system can decide to gain benefit in one or in another direction.</p>
<p>Finally, tables <a href="patents.html#tab:result-extraction-dl-a47g33">9.5</a> and <a href="patents.html#tab:result-extraction-dlw2v-a47g33">9.6</a> show an overview of extracted users randomly chosen from the A47G33 patent set (the only one in which were able to perform all experiments). Each table is divided in two blocks, representing the results of the extraction performed using a specific configuration. For each extracted user is shown the corresponding lemma (the root form), the frequency (how many times that user appears in the whole corpus) and the total number of patents containing the user. Users not contained in the starting user list, are highlighted in bold.</p>
<p>The table shows that the system was able to extract characteristic users of the patent set. The results are in fact not unexpected for the IPC class under analysis: this is an evidence of the correct performances of the proposed system. In other words, the results presented in the table show that it is possible to train a NER systems able to extract sparse and valuable information. Such users are the ones that an expert would manually extract but the NER system does it with an enormous saving in terms of time and efforts.</p>
<p>Other remarkable results are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>many newly extracted entities have very low frequency in the patent set: it shows that the developed system is able to extract rare entities.</p></li>
<li><p>table <a href="patents.html#tab:result-extraction-dlw2v-a47g33">9.6</a> shows that configurations using <em>word2vec</em> features are able to find new users with a higher frequency in the patent set: it was an expected result, since the <em>word2vec</em> configurations are not explicitly lexicalized and more able to generalize during extraction phase.</p></li>
<li><p>The system is able to extract single words and multi-words.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking into consideration the definition of user of an invention, the system extracts unusual and sometimes borderline users. Examples like <em>saint</em>, <em>angel</em>, <em>god</em> and <em>ghost</em> need discussion that is far beyond the purposes of the present paper. These results are a remarkable evidence of the human-like generalization ability of the described method.</p></li>

<p>The total number of users is 109. 28,2% (564 on 2.000) of patents in analysis contains at least one user. This result is an evidence of the fact that patents actually contain users information, and, considering the approach we followed, this percentage is an accurate lower approximation of the actual percentage of patents containing at least one user.</p>
<p>In figure <a href="patents.html#fig:patentsperuser">9.2</a> for each user on the x axes is shown the number of patents in which the user is contained. The distribution is skewed, with some occurrences showing large numbers and many others with just one or few occurrences. It is clear that there is a Pareto like distribution, with the first 20% of users covering 70% of total users in terms of occurrence. It means that some users are more likely to be cited in patents and many more users that rarely appear. Following this observations, we can divide users in three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Group A</em>: users that appear in more than 100 patents (5% of the patent set). In our case these are <em>male</em>, <em>child</em> and <em>female</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Group B</em>: users that appear in more than 20 patents (1% of the patent set). This group is composed by 13 different users. Some of these are <em>engineer</em>, <em>person</em>, <em>player</em>, <em>adult</em>, <em>angel</em> and _guy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Group C</em>: users that appear in less then 20 patents. This group is composed by 93 different users. Some of these are <em>mother</em>, <em>athlete</em>, <em>priest</em>, <em>adulterant</em>, <em>golfer</em> and <em>hockey player</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further research means to study how these users differ from patent set to patent set. We expect to see similar distribution but with different content of users. Frequent and non-specific users comprise Group A: in other patent set we could see differences in terms of entities contained in this class but its content will stay non-specific. These results seem to be generic social roles indicating the gender or the age of a person. Group B is composed of mainly non-specific users and some specific users that change from patent set to patent set. This class helps to identify the core users of the patent set. Lastly, Group C contains non-frequent users that are both specific and non-specific, making it the most interesting of the three for the purposes of our work. In this group we find users that are market niches, so the patent that contains these users is of great interest for marketers and designers. These are both samples of the more generic users (for example a <em>mother</em> is a <em>female</em> and a <em>hockey player</em> is a <em>player</em>) or specific users of the patent-set (like <em>priest</em>, <em>fund-raiser</em>, <em>doll</em>, <em>spouse</em> and <em>clergy member</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Advantages and Drawbacks</h2>
<p>An effective development of new products or the redesign of an existing one require the analysis of its positive and negative properties. Due to that, advantages and drawbacks of products are extremely valuable information for companies. Unfortunately, this information is not easy to obtain and manage: a strong evidence of that is the effort in the development of tools able to manage this information <span class="citation">(Pahl and Beitz <a href="#ref-pahl2013engineering">2013</a>, <span class="citation">Ulrich (<a href="#ref-ulrich2003product">2003</a>)</span>)</span>. Companies frequently make use of Quality Functional Deployment (QFD) and requisites lists, users’ needs, users’ requirements with the purpose of tracking advantages <span class="citation">(Carnevalli and Miguel <a href="#ref-carnevalli2008review">2008</a>)</span>. On the other hand, companies use Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to gather and study drawbacks, failure modes and their effects and causes <span class="citation">(Liu, Liu, and Liu <a href="#ref-liu2013risk">2013</a>.)</span> However, product developers can acquire QFD and FMEA data only from the users of the invention: this leads to the need of expensive processes of customer’s voice listening whose results are often unclear. Moreover, this information is not disclosed to researchers since this is part of the company know-how.</p>
<p>The description of the brought advantages and solved drawbacks are critical requirements for the patentability of a product, as stated by the politics and the guidelines given by World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on writing patents <span class="citation">(Organization <a href="#ref-world2004wipo">2004</a>)</span>. As stated by WIPO, an invention is a <em>solution</em> to a specific <em>problem</em> . The problem that an invention solves is a negative effect that state-of-the-art technologies can not fully overcome; on the other side, a solution is a way to solve this problem. A solution can lead to some advantages with respect to the known art. Thus, starting from the definition of invention, it is clear how it can be characterized by the advantages that it brings and by the problems that it solves. Also, it is reasonable to assume that having a clear picture of both advantages and drawbacks of a technology is important for an effective design process<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.1</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>In this section we show the approach used to extract the advantages and the drawbacks of the invention described in a patent. More precisely, the system identifies textual elements which represent the advantages or the drawbacks described in a patent. Advantages and drawbacks information can strongly advantage designers in the phase of new product development or in the process of product improvement and marketers in the phase of customer understanding and product placing. Furthermore a patent based method has a strong advantage with respected to methods that extracts information using other type of documents (e.g. online reviews of products <span class="citation">(Mirtalaie et al. <a href="#ref-monireh">2018</a><a href="#ref-monireh">a</a>)</span>): patents anticipate availability of products on the market by a factor varying from 6 to 18 months <span class="citation">(Golzio <a href="#ref-golzio2012">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The proposed extraction process is shown in figure <a href="patents.html#fig:advdrwprocessgeneral">9.3</a> and its macro-phases are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Advantage and Drawback Clues Collection</em>: in this section we described the method to collect a reasonable number of generic advantage and drawback clues;</li>
<li><em>Domain Clues Extraction</em>: in this section is shown how the generic clues are used in exploiting machine learning algorithm to extract new domain specific advantages and drawback clues;</li>
<li><em>Domain Clues Validation</em> : since the new clues are automatically extracted, the output of the extraction phase surely contains a certain degree of noise. To clean this output a validation tool based on tweeter sentiment analysis is developed;</li>
<li><em>Advantages and Drawbacks Extraction</em>: here the extracted clues (generic and domain specific) are expanded according to specific regular expression pattern in order to obtain the advantages and the drawbacks of the analyzed patent set.</li>

<h4>Clues of Advantages and drawbacks in patents</h4>
<p>First of all we have to define the concept of clue to an advantage or a drawback. To describe with a certain degree of precision an advantage or a drawback, patent writers need to use sequences of words of a certain length. Since NER systems do not perform well on long sequence of tokens, we split the problem of extracting advantages and drawbacks in two parts: first we extract entities that are clues in the sequence of words that describes the advantage or the drawback; then we extract the surrounding words to collect the whole sequence that describes the advantage or the drawback.</p>
<p>To better understand these concepts some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><advantage_clue> ease </advantage_clue> of access</p></li>
<li><p>cook food <advantage_clue> quickly </advantage_clue> and <advantage_clue>economically</advantage_clue></p></li>
<li><p><advantage_clue>benefits</advantage_clue> of keeping an outdoor cooker lid fixed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the present work, we refer to advantages and drawbacks as a sequence of words of minimal length that express the advantage or the drawback. The three phrases of the example are three advantages. On the other hand clues are words that are likely to be contained in advantages or drawbacks phrases.</p>

<p>The approaches to generate a knowledge base of clues were two. The first approach was based on a manual collection of clues of advantages and drawbacks directly from patent texts. This process was performed on 2,000 patents, randomly chosen from the freepatent database.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> With this approach we were able to collect 3,254 advantages and 5,142 drawback clues.

<p>The second approach consisted in looking for alternative methods to indicate advantages or drawbacks clues, looking defined word patterns.

<p>At the end of this process, a total of 6.568 advantages and the 14.809 drawbacks formed the knowledge base for the system, and gave us a reasonable number of clues to be used in the next step of the process.</p>
<p>The first approach was restricted by the lists being extracted from a random and limited sample of patents. On the other side, the rules used in the second approach are non exhaustive, and this can create non-sense clues, due to all of the possible combinations of words. Anyway, it is reasonable to assume that a large set of non-domain dependent clues are collected and will be used in the next steps of the process.</p>
<p>It is important to underline that the list of advantages and drawbacks clues is designed to avoid linguistic ambiguities when projecting these entities on the corpus. For example <em>guide</em> has two different meanings<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> when used as a verb or as a noun: as a verb it means <em>“to assist something or someone to travel through, or reach a destination in, an unfamiliar area, as by accompanying or giving directions”</em>, so it could be the clue to an advantage; at the same time as a noun it assumes the mean of <em>“a book, pamphlet, etc., giving information, instructions, or advice; handbook”</em> thus indicating a product and not an advantage. Avoiding such ambiguities is a crucial aspect to produce an informative training set, so ambiguous words were avoided to be projected on patents.</p>

<div id="domain-clues-extraction" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Domain Clues Extraction</h4>
<p>The domain-specific clues collection process takes in input the automatically annotated patent set 1. The analyzed patent set is automatically annotated using the domain-independent clues, and is used to extract new domain-specific clues. We decided for the present methods to analyze the whole text of the patents and not to focus only on a specific section.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Our system resorts to state-of-the-art NLP tools which are part of the linguistic analysis pipeline shown in figure <a href="patents.html#fig:advdrwarticleprocessfigclueexpansionphase">9.5</a>. In addition we developed a specific advantages and drawbacks clues extraction tool, still based on Natural Language Processing techniques.</p>
<p>The automatic patent set annotation 2 process, as shown in figure <a href="patents.html#fig:advdrwarticleprocessfigclueexpansionphase">9.5</a>, is composed by a set of sequential steps. The first three steps are related to the linguistic annotation: sentence splitting and tokenization, part of speech tagging and lemmatization. Once these three steps are completed the entity extractor collects the advantages and drawbacks clues from the analyzed patents.</p>
<p><em>Sentence splitting and Tokenization</em> steps split the text into sentences and then segment each sentence in orthographic units called tokens.</p>
<p>The <em>Part-Of-Speech tagging</em> (or POS tagging) step assigns unambiguous grammatical categories to the tokens. For the present application we use the most recent version of the Felice-POS-tagger described in <span class="citation">(Dell’Orletta <a href="#ref-dell2009ensemble">2009</a>)</span>. Once the computation of the POS-tagged text is completed, the text is automatically <em>lemmatized</em> in order to group inflected forms of a word in a single item. Some of the following steps of the entire extraction process exploit the lemmatized texts in order to achieve better extraction results.</p>
<p>Successively the <em>semi-automatic annotation of advantages and drawbacks clues</em> is performed. The advantages and drawbacks clues extraction tool is the key ingredient of the present paper, and it is based on supervised methods. Such methods require an entity annotated corpus in order to extract new entities from unseen documents. Since the manual annotation of a patent set is too expensive both in terms of time and manual effort, we apply a semi-automatic method to generate an advantage and drawback annotated corpus.</p>
<p>The entity annotation schema for a single token is defined using a widely accepted BIO annotation scheme <span class="citation">(Ramshaw and Marcus <a href="#ref-ramshaw">1999</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B-ADV</strong>: the token is the start of an entity representing an advantage clue;</li>
<li><strong>I-ADV</strong>: the token is the continuation of a sequence of tokens representing an advantage clue;</li>
<li><strong>B-DRW</strong>: the token is the start of an entity representing a drawback clue;</li>
<li><strong>I-DRW</strong>: the token is the continuation of a sequence of tokens representing a drawback clue;</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>: for the remaining case.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Advantages and Drawbacks Clues Extractor</em> is a supervised classifier that, given an annotated patent set, is trained on these examples. The patent set is: (a) linguistically-annotated, using the steps described above; (b) entity-annotated, exploiting the semiautomatic annotation process executed in the previous steps. Given a set of features the classifier trains a statistical model using the feature statistics extracted from the corpus. This trained model is then employed in the classification of unseen patents: it extracts new domain specific clues from patents and assigns them a probability score whether they are an advantage or a drawback. In our experiments the classifier has been trained using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning algorithm using the LIBSVM <span class="citation">(Hearst, Dumais, Osman, et al. <a href="#ref-svm">1998</a>)</span> library configured to use a linear kernel. The classifier uses two different kinds of features that are extracted from the text:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>raw features</strong>: prefix and suffix of the analyzed token; it works particularly well with advantages ending with -full -ious and with drawbacks starting with un- dis- etc..</p></li>
<li><p><strong>word2vec features</strong>: vector representations of words computed by the <em>word2vec</em> <span class="citation">(Mikolov et al. <a href="#ref-word2vec1">2013</a>)</span> tool.</p></li>

<p>By introducing prefixes and suffixes of the analyzed token, the classifier is able to identify frequent orthographic patterns which allow to maximize the precision in classification phase. On the other hand, the <em>word2vec</em> features are introduced in order to maximize the recall, since semantically similar clues should have similar <em>word2vec</em> vectors. Finally, the tag of the previous token is added to the final feature vector in order to improve the accuracy classification of multi-word clues.</p>
</div>
<div id="word2vec-feature-computation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Word2vec feature computation</h4>
<p>While contextual, linguistic and compositional features are commonly used for entity extraction task in patents, from a computational linguistic point of view the presented system introduces the novelty of using <em>word2vec</em> features for entity extraction in patents.</p>
<p><em>Word2vec</em> is a NLP tool able to produce word representations exploiting big corpora. The main property of the vectors produced by <em>word2vec</em> is that words that share similar contexts have similar vector representations. By using word vectors instead of the corresponding words we were able to overcome the problem of the limited lexical knowledge in the training phase.</p>
<p>To build our <em>word2vec</em> vectors we used the Skipgram model with a context window of 5 tokens. As reported in table <a href="patents.html#tab:word2vecpatents">9.10</a>, we used a corpus consisting of 48,194 different patents, containing more than 400,000,000 tokens.</p>
<p>The corpus was designed to contain patents belonging to different classes (12 in total) in order to acquire an extended knowledge of the contexts in which the words in general are surrounded. In addition, patents belonging to two of these classes are analyzed and, in the same section, detailed configurations of the entity extractor has been provided.</p>

Figure 9.6: Overview of the domain specific advantages and failures clue validation process.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="patents.html#fig:advdrwarticleprocessfigcluevalidationphase">9.6</a> gives an overview of the activities performed to validate the collected clues using twtitter. Since the manual review of the new domain specific clues can be very time consuming, an innovative approach to automatic validation of these entities is proposed. The approach is based on the assumption that advantages of technological innovations can be considered positive factors by the users. Conversely, the drawbacks of the artifacts are considered negative factors impacting on the satisfaction of the users. Both advantages and drawbacks are common terms or chunks of terms commonly used in other contexts, too. Therefore, if we can identify a wide source of sentences tagged with a polarity score and containing advantages or drawbacks, the probability of assigning the proper polarity to advantages and drawbacks increases.</p>
<p>Social media platforms provide powerful venues for consumers to interact not only with brands but also with other consumers as they engage in the processes of curation, creation, and collaboration <span class="citation">(Evans, Bratton, and McKee <a href="#ref-evans2010social">2010</a>)</span>. Such virtual platforms are places where users discuss about products, about their features but also about problems and failures they experienced during the daily use. The way they discuss or describe products or services is often unambiguous and highly polarized.</p>
<p>Our approach to the automatic validation of advantages and drawbacks exploits the information contained in the Twitter platform.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> More precisely, for each extracted advantage or drawback clue we collect a set of tweets in which the clue is mentioned. Once a significant number of tweets is collected (in our case 3,073,959 - around 2,738 per entity in average), they are analyzed by a sentiment classifier. The main idea behind this process is to assign to each clue a sentiment polarity score which should express the feeling of the user with respect to the considered clue on the social media.</p>
<p>The tweet collection can be easily performed by using the Twitter streaming API,<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> which is freely available. By assigning a polarity score to each clue, we expect to detect tagging anomalies: entities tagged as advantages by the classifier are expected to have a positive polarity in the extracted tweets. Vice versa, entities tagged as drawbacks by the classifier are expected to have a negative polarity in the extracted tweets.</p>

<h4>Sentiment Classifier: features, classification model and performance evaluation</h4>
<p>In our sentiment classifier we focused on a wide set of features ranging across different levels of linguistic description. The whole set of features we started with is described below, organized into four main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>raw and lexical text features</li>
<li>morpho-syntactic features</li>
<li>syntactic features</li>
<li>lexicon features.</li>
</ul>
<p>This proposed four-fold partition closely follows the different levels of linguistic analysis which is automatically carried out on the text being evaluated, (i.e. tokenization, lemmatization, morpho-syntactic tagging and dependency parsing) and the use of external lexical resources.</p>
<p>Raw and lexical text features are extracted considering the text available in the tweet. For this work we considered a number of tokens, character n-grams, word n-grams, lemma n-grams, char repetition sequences, mentions number, hashtags number and punctuation.</p>
<p>Morpho-syntactic and Syntactic Features consider the part of speech tags and the syntactic analysis of the text. Our sentiment analyzer extracts Part-Of-Speech n-grams (coarse and fine), coarse grained Part-Of-Speech distribution and syntactic dependency types n-grams.</p>
<p>To extract features based on lexicons we exploited three freely available resources. The Bing Liu Lexicon <span class="citation">(Hu and Liu <a href="#ref-hu2004mining">2004</a>)</span>, which includes approximately 6,000 English words, the Multi–Perspective Question Answering Subjectivity Lexicon <span class="citation">(Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann <a href="#ref-wilson2005recognizing">2005</a>)</span>, which consists of approximately 8,200 English words and the SentiWordNet 3.0 Lexicon <span class="citation">(Baccianella, Esuli, and Sebastiani <a href="#ref-baccianella2010sentiwordnet">2010</a>)</span> which consists of more than 117,000 words. For each word in these lexicons the associated polarity is provided. In addition, we manually developed a lexicon of positive and negative emoticons, which usually is a strong indicator of tweets polarity. By exploiting the described resources, the following features were extracted: positive/negative emoticon distribution, sentiment polarity n-grams, sentiment polarity modifiers, the distribution of sentiment polarity, the most frequent sentiment polarity and changes of polarity in tweet sections. A more detailed description of these features is provided in [<span class="citation">Cimino et al. (<a href="#ref-cimino2014linguistically">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to assign a sentiment polarity score to each tweet, we employed an adapted version of the ItaliaNLP Sentiment Polarity Classifier for the English language <span class="citation">(Cimino et al. <a href="#ref-cimino2014linguistically">2014</a>)</span>. This classifier operates on morpho-syntactically tagged and dependency parsed texts and assigns to each document a score expressing its probability of belonging to a given polarity class. The highest score represents the most probable class. Given a set of features and a training corpus, the classifier creates a statistical model using the feature statistics extracted from the training corpus. This model is used in the classification of unseen documents. The set of features and the machine learning algorithm can be parametrized through a configuration file. For this work, we used a tandem Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) - Support Vector Machines (SVM) architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="validation-of-the-extracted-clues" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Validation of the extracted clues</h4>
<p>The sentiment classifier is employed to validate the advantage and drawback clues which were previously extracted from patents by the clue extractor. In order to do so, we exploited the output of the tweet classifier on the tweets we previously downloaded. Each tweet, as said before, contains one or more clues to be validated. The sentiment classifier assigns the likeliness to each tweet to positive, neutral or negative. Consequently by analyzing all the tweets we previously downloaded, we obtained for each clue the distribution of positive, neutral and negative tweets.</p>
<p>Then to make a decision regarding each clue we used another SVM based classifier. This classifier is trained on a gold set of advantages and drawbacks clues: we manually labeled 344 words as advantages and 193 words as drawbacks, obtaining the gold set. The features used by this classifier are a number of positive, neutral and negative tweets extracted in which the entities are mentioned and the <em>word2vec</em> vector representing the considered entity. In table <a href="patents.html#tab:sentiment-validation">9.11</a> the classification results of the proposed approach over a 5-fold cross validation are reported. The obtained results show that the proposed entity validation method is suitable for the automatic advantages/drawbacks clues validation process.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The advantages and drawbacks extraction process is shown in figure <a href="patents.html#fig:advantagedrawbacksextraction">9.7</a>. Once all the domain specific advantages and drawbacks clues are extracted, these are merged with the ones belonging to the original knowledge base, obtaining a final list which will be processed by the advantages and drawbacks sentences extractor. The advantages and drawbacks sentences extractor exploits predefined linguistic and clues filters which operate on the automatic pos–tagged patents. Specifically, for each advantage and drawback term identified in patents, we used a pos–clue-pattern constraining the start-token and the rest of the token pos. Since we were interested in phrases containing words belonging to specific morphological categories, we identified sequences of allowed pos–clue-pattern in order to cover most of the English morphosyntactic multi–words structures, using the following pattern:</p>
<p>(ADVClue|textbar DISClue)+Noun.*Noun.*Noun.</p>
<p>The pattern is applied to the previously lemmatized text in order to have less sparse and more informative extractions.</p>
<p>This choice was made because the pattern:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>expresses an advantage or a drawback exhaustively;</li>
<li>increases the precision and the recall of the final output list of advantages and drawbacks;</li>
<li>allows to build a three-level named based tree over the final output list.</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, the tree is built by grouping terms which share at the first level the same clue, at the second level the same noun and at the third level the same noun. This grouping procedure allows to easily represent the final output list in a tree structure which can be easily navigated by the end user of the system.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.2</span> Results</h3>
<p>In this section we describe the experimental use of the proposed process by applying it on four different patent sets.</p>
<p>To test the proposed methodology, we chose 4 patent sets composed of a sample of 3,000 patents each. The patent sets belong to 4 different IPC patent classes. The chosen classes and the definitions given by WIPO are reported in table <a href="patents.html#tab:advdrwarticleexampleipcclasses">9.12</a>.</p>

<p>Our choice of patent sets aimed at challenging our system to find new domain specific advantages and drawback clues in different domains. Furthermore, we only selected patent sets from the IPC class A, which is based on human necessities, to maximize the probability of finding advantages and drawbacks that impacts on the users and not only on other products/components.</p>
<p>Once the advantages and drawbacks are extracted, a manual review process was performed on the output of the system to compute the number of true positive clues. In this way we were able to compute the precision of the process for both the advantages and the drawbacks. The output of the clue extraction validated by the clue validator is analyzed in table <a href="patents.html#tab:advdrwarticlecluemeas">9.13</a>.</p>
<p>The table shows that the number of the extracted true positive advantage clues is higher than the number of the extracted true positive drawback clues. On the other side, the automatic evaluation process has a lower performance on advantage clues in terms of precision.</p>
<p>A first hypotheses to explain these results is that our knowledge base contained more drawback clues than advantage clues. Another possible reason could be that the applicant is minded to describe the invention highlighting the positive effects of the invention.</p>

<p>In order to assess the performance of the overall process, another important measure is the amount of new information that is obtained, which we call <em>information gain</em>. As shown in table <a href="patents.html#tab:infogain1">9.14</a>, the percentage of new discovered clues decreases with the number of starting clues. Obviously, the more patent sets are analyzed, the less new generic and domain specific clues are extracted. The percentage of information gain (represented as delta in the table), stabilizes at a 5% value in the advantage clues case, and 1% in the drawback clues case. This trend could be an evidence that the clue extraction process has a natural saturation level.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="patents.html#fig:processimagetest1">9.8</a> and <a href="patents.html#fig:processimagetest2">9.9</a> show two subsets of the taxonomies obtained by the extraction of the advantages and drawbacks for each of the four analyzed patent sets. The two figures respectively refers to a subset of the leaves linked to the advantage clue <em>Improve</em> and a subset of the leaves linked to the drawback clue _Damage. In both cases an additional trimming action is performed by removing those branches or leaves containing terms belonging to the stop-word list typical of patent lexicon (e.g. claim, embodiment, invention, comprise, figure, etc..). The figure shows that our process can extract highly informative sentences also starting from generic and non-contextual clues like <em>improve</em> or <em>damage</em>. Moreover the words that follow the generic clues are specific of the technical field of the analyzed products. Both the results are promising for future applications, especially for the design fields. In particular figure <a href="patents.html#fig:processimagetest1">9.8</a> allows designers to focus on the positive side of the effects provided by the product and to better meet the explicit and implicit user needs. Similarly, figure <a href="patents.html#fig:processimagetest2">9.9</a> helps designers to redesign of the product in a proactive way, to keep attention to the critical issues identified by the drawbacks and to conceive possible corrective actions to solve such drawbacks.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Trademakrs</h2>
<p>The market interest for both patents and trademarks has increased during the last decades, with a significant increase in filing for both types of Intellectual Property. The academia also took attention to patent data and trademark data, but with different and (almost) disconnected research approaches. Furthermore, the analysis of patents to study R&amp;D is predominant while less attention has been paid to trademarks <span class="citation">(Griliches <a href="#ref-griliches1981market">1981</a>)</span>. Indeed, very few are the works where patents and trademarks are investigated together and not generically cited together as parts of the intellectual property right framework. Moreover cultural differences exist between United States and Europe (at least) and practical consequences can be observed in daily life: for example, even if Europe had an earlier and more enduring interest in trademarking than the US the presence of the symbols ® and ™ in the product labels are more common in US than in Europe <span class="citation">(MERCER, Lopes, and DUGUID <a href="#ref-mercer2010reading">2010</a>)</span>. The difference exists also from an industrial perspective, across different sectors <span class="citation">(Baroncelli, Fink, and Smarzynska <a href="#ref-baroncelli2004global">2004</a>)</span>. Indeed, trademarks have their larger use worldwide in the R&amp;D intensive scientific equipment, pharmaceuticals sector and advertising intensive manufacturing industries (clothing, footwear, detergents and food products).</p>
<p>The present chapter studies the usage (if any) of <em>trademarks</em> and <em>trade symbols</em> within patent texts. The aim is to investigate possible indicators about IP strategies and innovation output utilizing information about the interlink between patents and trademarks. An additional goal is to understand if patent applicants makes a right use of trademarks and trade symbols when writing a patent document. The analysis clearly stands at the boundary between patent and trademark research areas, and since such intermediate territory has not been investigated in depth, there are several research questions we would like to answer. The starting point is a sheer numerical evidence: we have found out that, at the date of 01/09/2017, a total of 2.162.962 patents worldwide (for details about the database and its coverage see section 3) contain a trademark symbol. It is therefore a not negligible phenomenon, worth of investigation and that should provide interesting insights about the mechanisms and strategies that companies adopt at the frontier between technical innovation and marketing.</p>
<div id="the-use-of-trademark-symbols-and-in-patents-from-a-legal-perspective" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The use of trademark symbols ™ and ® in patents from a legal perspective</h4>
<p>It is evident from our preliminary analysis that there exist an high number of patent documents containing a trademark indication. In the present section we investigate what is the legal perspective of this usage.</p>
<p>In <span class="citation">(Butler <a href="#ref-butler1969rules">1969</a>)</span> the authors published a series of rules to standardize the use of trade terms in patents. They also specifies different rules in the case of use of trade terms in specifications and the use of trade terms in patent claims. The rules are:</p>
<p>1- A trade term is properly used in a specification if those skilled in the art can make the product designated by the trade term at the time the application is filed, using the specification and/or published literature that is implicated by the specification. 2- A trade term is also properly used in a specification if the product is generally known to persons skilled in the art and is readily obtainable at the time the application is filed, provided the composition of the product is a trade secret and there is reason to believe that whenever the composition of the product is modified the trade term will also be changed. 3- A trade term is also properly used in a specification if it designates a component of the embodiment which is not essential to the invention. 4- A trade term can be used in a claim only if its meaning has been adequately defined in the specifications, whereby it imparts specific limitations to the claim.”</p>
<p>The second rule is particularly interesting because it seems preventing early patenting or patenting before having produced and used a trade name. Rule number two is even more interesting since it contains a case of a product that is a trade secret used to build another product subject to patent application.</p>
<p>Similar guidelines are contained in the European patent convention <span class="citation">(Hall and Helmers <a href="#ref-hall2018impact">2018</a>)</span>. Here is state that is not desirable to use trademarks or trade names if such words merely denote origin or where they may relate to a range of different products. Anyway trademarks could be used in patent application to satisfy art.83, that states that the application shall disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. In this case the product must be sufficiently identified, without reliance upon the word. A special case are such words that have become internationally accepted as standard descriptive terms and have acquired a precise meaning (e.g. “Bowden” cable, “Belleville” washer, “Panhard” rod, “caterpillar” belt). In this case they may be allowed without further identification of the product to which they relate. It is clear specifications afflicts the analysis that we want to carry out. Always in the same document are given also guidelines for the usage of trademarks in claims. These are, as expected, different from the specifications. For claims we have the problem that it may not be guaranteed that the product or feature referred to is not modified while maintaining its name during the term of the patent. They may be allowed exceptionally if their use is unavoidable and they are generally recognised as having a precise meaning. It is the applicant’s responsibility then to ensure that registered trademarks are acknowledged as such in the description. From that we can deduce that the presence of a trademark in patents and more specifically in claims decreases the reproducibility of the invention and thus the quality of the patent. Also the the US patent legislation <span class="citation">(Jaffe <a href="#ref-jaffe2000us">2000</a>)</span> focuses on the use of trademarks in patents claims. Here the presence of a trademark or trade name in a claim is not considered improper but the examiner should analyze the claim to determine how the mark or name is used. In fact, the trademark or trade name should identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. In this case the claim scope is uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any particular material or product. In fact, the value of a trademark would be lost to the extent that it became descriptive of a product, rather than used as an identification of a source or origin of a product. Thus, the use of a trademark or trade name in a claim to identify or describe a material or product would not only render a claim indefinite, but would also constitute an improper use of the trademark or trade name.</p>
<p>Finally, in <span class="citation">(Pressman and Stim <a href="#ref-pressman2018nolo">2018</a>)</span> the authors gives some guidelines on how to introduce trademarks when it is unavoidable. First, the trademark should be capitalized and used as an adjective (not a noun), followed by the generic name of the product or service. Furthermore when referring to the trademark there should also be a reference to the trademark owner.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.1</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>With respect to Users @ref(#usersresults) and to Advantages and Distadvantages @ref(#advdrwresults) the process to extract tradenames from patents is trivial. The main activity performed are (for details aobut the activities see section <a href="sotatools.html#sotatools">7</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentence splitting</li>
<li>Tokenization</li>
<li>Part-of-speech tagging</li>
<li>Lemmatization</li>
</ul>
<p>After that is is possibile to identify tradenames searching for the symbols ™ and ®.</p>
</div>
<div id="results-2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.2</span> Results</h3>
<p>The first investigation has the aim of understanding if the ™ and ® symbols has different content depending on different IPC <span class="citation">(Organization <a href="#ref-wipo1">1971</a>)</span> classes. The IPC classes are: The main evidence in figure <a href="patents.html#fig:histtm">9.10</a> is that ® is used more than ™ in patent, with and average percent of presence of 7.4% and 5.6% respectively. The reason of this evidence could be that patents contains unregistered trademarks that are never converted to registered trademarks; another reason is the confusion between the ® and ™ symbol, usually considered as synonymous. Furthermore the writer will use the symbol only if he/she knows that the mark is protected, otherwise he/she will not indicate any symbols or will use ™ or ® without checking the right use. Another possible problem is that the word has become of common use and thus usually used without symbols. Furthemore, classes A (Human Necessities) and C (Chemistry; Metallurgy) clearly has more trade symbols than the other classes.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Secondly, from table <a href="patents.html#tab:ipcclassestm">9.18</a> it is evident that the average ratio is 6.4 for ® (the usage is 6.4 times higher in the year span 2007-2014 than the span 1995-2002) and 5.4 for ™ (the usage is 5.4 times higher in the year span 2007-2014 than the span 1995-2002) thus the usage of trade-symbols in patent is growing and the presence of ® is increasing faster than the presence of ™. From the present results is not possible to say if this effect is due to an higher quality of the process of patent application (and thus an higher awareness of applicant and examiner) or of a positive trend in trademark registration. In particular for the IPC class E (fields constructions) the number of ® and ™ has increased 10.5 and 9.0 times respectively. This could be an evidence of the fact that the number of trademark in the field of fixed constructions is increasing.</p>

In the previous analysis we noticed that ® is generally more used than ™. Now the goal is to understand if patent writers uses tradesymbols or not when citing tradenames, if there are any differences between different tradenames and if we can notice different behaviours in recent years. From figure <a href="patents.html#fig:tmlistcpmplete">9.11</a> is evident that despite the fact that it is mandatory to use ™ o ®, these symbols are not always used.</p>

<h4>Tradenames Usage in Patents</h4>
<p>It is relevant to understand if there exists any difference between different tradenames in the correct usage of trade symbols (a trade name has been cited in the patent texts with the trade symbol). Figure <a href="patents.html#fig:tmcitedwell">9.12</a> illustrates in a bi-logaritmic plot the distribution of trade names correctly cited in patents with ® and ™ (Y-axis) versus the same trade names cited without using the proper symbol. Most of trade names are located under the diagonal. Those around the diagonal are those we can considered as well known trademarks and not so subject to genericization phenomena (green area). Conversely on the right we can find a read area where the ratio is even more shifted toward the absence of any indication of protected trademark. In the middle the orange area where many of the most famous trademarks fall down and that could be in phase of generalisation or conversely, since the trademark of a product is totally entangled with the owner (Iphone-Apple; Intel), inventors do not feel the reason to cite them as a trademark. A remark on Figure <a href="patents.html#fig:tmcitedwell">9.12</a> is necessary: the plot presents a correct measurement of trademarks with ® and ™ plotted in the y axis, while the search for trademark with missing trademark symbols in some case can introduce undesired errors and include other meaning of the word. Take for example the case of Blackberry®: the datum is referring to mobile phones and accessories or software applications. In all the cases where ® or ™ are correctly written, it is probably true that the inventor is referring to the Blackberry® mobile phones, but machines for jam or juice production extracted out of the blackberry introduce false positive examples. Similarly Fender is probably located too far on the right because it is also a part of a car, bike, motorbike, boat, etc.. and Gibson could introduce citations of works performed by someone called Gibson, therefore if cleaned results are necessary the searching strategies for the trademarks without symbols have to be refined.</p>

<h4>The Popularity of Tradenames in Patens</h4>

<h4>The Similarity of Tradenames in Patens</h4>
<p>Further informations can be derived by analysing the IPC classes where the patent have been chosen by the assignees-attorneys-examiners.The choice of a class is not only matter of market segment but rather of market use. Moreover it is necessary to remark that from a formal point of view the IPC classes form a feature vector, denoted y ∈ N639. IPC classes form a complete dataset of 639 elements of such feature vector. Each tradename is represented in such a feature vector where the number of patents in each class constitutes the length of the vector along that direction (feature). Our training data is therefore D = (x,y,z), where x∈[1, .., 12], y∈[1, .., 639], and z represents the patent numerosity z∈[0..15*106]. This dataset contains information about how z varies as a function of x and y. The matrix is quite empty since each product/brand addresses needs of specific market/s, after cleaning of the totally empty columns the matrix reduces to the dimensions of 12x479 and demonstrates a correct choice of the trademarks since they covered almost 75% of the IPC space.</p>
<p>With such a dataset a series of computations can be performed: here we show the results of the correlation analysis among the chosen trademarks to analyse their relative positioning on the invention landscape (not only the market); Correlation analysis is shown in Figure <a href="patents.html#fig:similartm">9.14</a> The matrix is triangular owing to the symmetry of the relationship. The main evidences are the following:</p>
