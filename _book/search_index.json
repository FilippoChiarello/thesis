While the first techniques are codified and explicit, the second are sometimes implicit and always harder to systematize. In this section i treat these two groups of techniques in the same way to give to the reader a sistematic litterature review on these topics. For this reason the sections of this chapter has the sequent structure: At a first level we have two sections 2.1 and 2.2, reviewing respectivelly the processes of programming and Natural Language Processing and of undestanding and knowldege of field experts application; Section 2.1 has a subsection for each of the phases showed in figure ??. These subsections goes from 2.1.1 to 2.1.7; Each subsection from 2.1.1 to 2.1.7 contains the relative Natural Language Processing task that are relevant for the analysis of technical documents, for example Document Retrieval 2.1.2.1, Part-Of-Speech-Tagging; 2.1.4.4 or Named Entity Recognition 2.1.5.4. Each task subsection describes the relevant techniques to perform that task. I use the word techniques to include mainly algorythms and procedures but also more generic methods or frameworks; Since the second section 2.2 describes less systematics phases, task and techniques this section opens with a first subsection 2.2.1 that focuses on the studies of the problems of using expert knowledge in an analytical process and which are the techniques to convert this knowledge in a format that is usable in a Natural Language Processing workflow. Finally, always section 2.2 has a subsection for each of the technical documents I analyzed (aggiungi gancio con introduzione). These subsections goes from 2.2.2 to 2.2.7. 2.1 Phases, Tasks, and Techniques In this section I make a review of the most important techniques for Natural Language Processing in the context of technical documents analysis. The techniques (mainly algorythms) are grouped in phases (Import, Tidy, Transform, Model, Visualize, Communicate) showed in figure ?? and each phases is dived in the NLP tasks that are the most important for the analysis of technical documents. The algorythms i reviewed in this section are summmarised in table tot, where the reader can see the relationship between tasks and techniques. 2.1.1 Program Articoli Emily 2.1.2 Import 2.1.2.1 Document Retrieval 2.1.3 Tidy 2.1.4 Transform 2.1.4.1 Stemming 2.1.4.2 Lemmatisation 2.1.4.3 N-Grams 2.1.4.4 Part-of-Speech Tagging 2.1.4.5 Regular Expressions 2.1.5 Model 2.1.5.1 Document Classification 2.1.5.2 Network Analysis 2.1.5.3 Sentiment Analsysis 2.1.5.4 Named Entity Recognition 2.1.5.5 Vector Semantics 2.1.5.6 Topic Modelling 2.1.6 Visualize 2.1.7 Comunicate 2.2 Documents 2.2.1 Understand 2.2.1.1 The problem of byases 2.2.1.2 The Importance of Lexicons for Technical Documents Analysis 2.2.2 Patents 2.2.3 Papers 2.2.4 Projects 2.2.5 Wikipedia 2.2.6 Twitter 2.2.7 Job Profiles "]
