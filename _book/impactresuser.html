<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Impact of Research from the Perspective of Users</h1>
<p>A substantive interest has been developed in the last 15 years on the so-called “impact revolution”, namely the increasing demand for showcasing the results of publicly funded research in order to justify public expenditure. Public funders are increasingly required to demonstrate the relevance of funded research not only for scientific communities but also for the economy and society at large. In other words, there is an increasing demand to prove that the users and beneficiaries of research results are not only the traditional academic audience - researchers and university students - but include a large number of social actors. Let use use here the concept of “societal impact”, as opposed to academic impact, to include all dimensions of impact on the society and economy that are realized through impact pathways that go beyond the institutional research and teaching activities.</p>
<p>The issue of societal impact of public research has gained prominence in the specialized literature since the start of the century and has accelerated in recent years <span class="citation">(Van der Meulen and Rip <a href="#ref-van2000evaluation">2000</a>; Ernø-Kjølhede and Hansson <a href="#ref-erno2011measuring">2011</a>; Bornmann <a href="#ref-bornmann2013societal">2013</a>; Bornmann and Marx <a href="#ref-bornmann2014evaluate">2014</a>; Bornmann and Haunschild <a href="#ref-bornmann2017does">2017</a>)</span>. Indeed, a quick look at the most important journals in the field of innovation, research policy and research evaluation shows that the most largely cited, downloaded or read articles in the last five years are almost invariably dedicated to the issue of societal impact.</p>
<p>This follows from the adoption of societal impact of research as one dimension of evalution of research, both ex ante and ex post, in many advanced countries.</p>
<p>As discussed by several authors, societal impact has become one of the criteria of ex ante project selection in several institutions and countries <span class="citation">(Kanninen and Lemola <a href="#ref-kanninen2006methods">2006</a>; Dance <a href="#ref-dance2013impact">2013</a>)</span>. It is also a crucial chapter in the ex post research assessment in some countries, such as United Kingdom. Within the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) the assessment of societal impact has been responsible for 20% of the total score, while an increase to 25% has been announced in September 2017 for the future exercise. The publication of REF case studies of societal impact has fueled a field of analysis <span class="citation">(Derrick, Meijer, and Van Wijk <a href="#ref-derrick2014unwrapping">2014</a>; Samuel and Derrick <a href="#ref-samuel2015societal">2015</a>; Khazragui and Hudson <a href="#ref-khazragui2014measuring">2014</a>)</span>. Some authors advocate impact analysis as a way to examine the effects of research agenda on the societal priorities <span class="citation">(Cozzens, Bobb, and Bortagaray <a href="#ref-cozzens2002evaluating">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This surge of policy interest, however, comes in a period in which the scientific analysis of the concept of societal impact and of the potential and limits of existing methodologies has not yet come to a general agreement. As succinctly stated by Lutz Bornmann, impact evaluation is “still in the infant stage” <span class="citation">(Bornmann <a href="#ref-bornmann2013societal">2013</a>)</span>. And Bozeman and Sarewitz <span class="citation">(Bozeman and Sarewitz <a href="#ref-bozeman2011public">2011</a>)</span> explained that “there has been remarkably little progress in the ability to measure directly, systematically, and validly the impacts of research on social change”, so that “we have no satisfactory analytical tools for characterizing the social impact (of research)” <span class="citation">(Bozeman and Sarewitz <a href="#ref-bozeman2011public">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This paper is a contribution to the substantive and methodological work on the assessment of societal impact of research. From the substantive point of view, it introduces the notion of target group, or group of potential users of research, as a necessary component of the design and implementation of research projects. From the methodological point of view, the paper strongly supports the idea, already advanced in the literature, that Text mining techniques are promising in this field, but suggests a major modification by introducing the Enriched dictionary methodology.</p>
<p>To be more precise we argue that a necessary component for impact assessment is the definition of users of research at a granular level. In addition, we suggest that the more researchers are able to define precisely their target groups the more they are likely to reach them effectively and to increase the impact. We develop a full scale, replicable and scalable methodology to identify the user groups mentioned in research-based texts, such as research proposals (ex ante), impact case studies (ex post), or publications. We test the methodology on the collection of case studies developed under the Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the United Kingdom. We examine three main dimensions of user target groups (frequency, intensity and specificity) and disaggregate the data by broad discipline.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Methodological challenges</h2>
<div id="variability-in-the-identification-of-outcomes-and-users" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.1</span> Variability in the identification of outcomes and users</h3>
<p>A first methodological issue is that in order to assess the societal impact of research, there is a need not only to identify observable elements that can be considered as an outcome of the research process, but also to define the actors that are affected, or benefit, from those outcomes. It turns that these elements are subject to huge variability across disciplines. Consequently, there are areas in which methodologies are more sophisticated and largely tested, and others in which there is remarkable lack of experience and methodological work <span class="citation">(Stern et al. <a href="#ref-stern2013long">2013</a>; Mitton et al. <a href="#ref-mitton2007knowledge">2007</a>, <span class="citation">Ţurcan (<a href="#ref-cturcan2015national">2015</a>)</span>)</span></p>
<p>Among the former the health care sector is probably the one in which the impact assessment of research has made the largest progresses: a number of well structured research impact assessment methodologies have been developed and implemented. There in fact are as many as 16 different impact assessment models, according to Milat, Bauman and Redman <span class="citation">(Milat, Bauman, and Redman <a href="#ref-milat2015narrative">2015</a>)</span>. An important reason for this accumulation of experience and knowledge is that the outcomes that demonstrate the expected impact are clearly identified and standardized, and the categories of users are clearly observed, given a high degree of professionalism.</p>
<p>At the opposite side of the spectrum, there is still much uncertainty about the way in which the societal impact of research in social sciences and humanities (SSH) could be defined and observed, even less quantified and measured. The challenges associated with identifying the impact of outputs from these fields stem from a number of issues, most of which have been noted in earlier evaluation-based literature. According to certain theoretical perspectives the very notion of impact is problematic for SSH <span class="citation">(Blasi, Romagnosi, and Bonaccorsi <a href="#ref-blasi2018ssh">2018</a>)</span>. From a historical perspective, it has become increasingly clear that research across SSH has had a large influence on modern societies on a long time scale <span class="citation">(Bod <a href="#ref-bod2013new">2013</a>)</span>. It should be recognised therefore that a certain share of research need not be asked to demonstrate any impact, but be valued for its own sake <span class="citation">(Small <a href="#ref-small2013value">2013</a>)</span>. It is part of the millennial history of humankind that some people, some ages of life, some resources are dedicated to the search for intangible and priceless goals such as beauty or truth. Research from the arts and humanities is needed in order to preserve in society the ability to interpret, appreciate, enjoy and valorize symbolic values inherited from the past. Should the many scholars from this field be interrupted or deprived, modern societies would rapidly become unable to coordinate, administer and govern themselves.</p>
<p>Consider the problem from the perspective of potential users of SSH research: the results or products are not necessarily used on the basis of direct access to scientific sources (as it happens more frequently with technological and biomedical research), but after some transformation and intermediation by specialised actors (e.g. journalists of popular magazines; social media). Furthermore they do not necessarily take the form of compelling evidence, or ultimate scientific authority, but enter into a social arena for public and political conversations and debate, where arguments may be advanced and refuted. In addition, audiences may be dispersed, non-institutionalized, or even transient (e.g. issue-based) and not professional. Finally, social behaviors are by definition slow to change, thus the impact of research is likely to be seen only after a long delay. This means that both outcomes and categories of users are much more difficult to identify and define.</p>
</div>
<div id="sources-of-information" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.2</span> Sources of information</h3>
<p>Current approaches can be classified, according to Morton <span class="citation">(Morton <a href="#ref-morton2015progressing">2015</a>)</span>, as forward tracking, backward tracking, and evaluation of mechanisms. In forward tracking, researchers are asked to reconstruct the ways in which their research might be useful for given categories of users. Alternatively, users are asked to declare which kind of research results they are likely to utilize <span class="citation">(Tang et al. <a href="#ref-tang2000pilot">2000</a>)</span>. The strong limitation of this approach is that it relies heavily on the researcher’s and research user’s own recollections of research use <span class="citation">(Nutley, Walter, and Davies <a href="#ref-nutley2007using">2007</a>; Donovan <a href="#ref-donovan2011state">2011</a>)</span>. In some sense, this is also the limitation of the use of case studies of research impact: it is difficult to verify whether they are a random collection or they are biased in one way or another. Backward tracking suffers less from these subjective biases. If the sample of final outcomes is well designed, it can offer important lessons for researchers and policy makers. However, it comes with long delays with respect to actual research results.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this methodology is the one largely adopted in impact assessment of health-related research: once it is agreed that clinical guidelines are a suitable candidate for assessment, it is possible to trace back the impact using the citations to the medical literature. Evaluation of mechanisms is a partial methodology, which describes in great detail the pathways in which research results are channeled from their origin to the endpoint.</p>
</div>
<div id="text-based-impact-assessment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.3</span> Text-based impact assessment</h3>
<p>More recently, an interesting alternative approach has been suggested. Based on the availability of Machine learning and Text mining techniques, it has been argued that the evidence for the impact of research might be traced by extracting selected expressions from certain kinds of documents. We may distinguish between two kinds of documents: (a) produced by users of research; (b) produced by researchers themselves.</p>
<p>There are several suggestions to use documents produced by users of research. In one of the most developed efforts to conceptualize the social impact of research, called Public Value Mapping (PVM) Bozeman and Sarewitz <span class="citation">(Bozeman and Sarewitz <a href="#ref-bozeman2011public">2011</a>)</span> suggested the use of three main sources of statements, from which it could be possible to trace the impact of research: government statements, academic literature, and public opinion polls containing public statements. More recently, Bornmann, Haunschild and Marx <span class="citation">(Bornmann, Haunschild, and Marx <a href="#ref-bornmann2016policy">2016</a>)</span> have suggested to use the frequency of occurrence of policy-related words in policy documents as evidence of impact of research. In this paper we will make these suggestions operational.</p>
<p>Yet another approach in the same line is to examine the documents produced within social media. A prominent approach is based on Altmetrics measures. The main tenet of Altmetrics is that citations, the basic unit of analysis of bibliometrics, capture only part of the impact of published research, so that “citation tracking has never been able to follow the less visible- but often more important- threads of invisible colleges, woven through personal connections and informal communications” <span class="citation">(Priem, Piwowar, and Hemminger <a href="#ref-priem2012altmetrics">2012</a>)</span>. By accessing data on the personal use of published materials “Altmetrics could deliver information about impacts on diverse audiences, like clinicians, practitioners, and the general public, as well as help to track the use of diverse research products like datasets, software, and blog posts” (ib.). Sibele et al. <span class="citation">(Fausto et al. <a href="#ref-fausto2012research">2012</a>)</span> examine in this light the phenomenon of research blogging. There are however severe limitations that might make Altmetrics problematic. The extent to which Altmetrics can capture traces of societal impact has recently been seriously contested <span class="citation">(Bornmann and Marx <a href="#ref-bornmann2014evaluate">2014</a>)</span>. Social media are used more for internal discussions within scientific communities, rather than a bridge between the research community and society at large. According to Haustein there is lack of evidence that social media events can serve as appropriate indicators of societal impact <span class="citation">(Haustein et al. <a href="#ref-haustein2016tweets">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Among the documents produced by researchers, we might further distinguish between: (a) research proposals (ex ante documents) and (b) case studies produced after the realization of research projects (ex post, or documents produced within the research assessment process).</p>
<p>It is this type of documents we suggest to examine as a novel methodology to assess the potential societal impact of research. In this paper we follow type (b) documents and use the collection of case studies produced by UK researchers under the REF exercise. In future studies we plan to use archives of proposals made available in public sources in order to examine the ex ante representation of researchers.</p>
<p>The REF impact case studies, as already noted, have been the object of a large literature in recent years. Among these studies, King’s College and Digital Science <span class="citation">(London and Science <a href="#ref-king2015nature">2015</a>)</span> have indeed produced, using Text mining techniques, an interesting analysis of beneficiaries of UK research, publishing a fascinating infographics. This analysis, however, lists only a fairly small set of research users, most of which are defined with generic terms. It is our contention that much further work should be done in this direction. We propose a new lexicon-based methodology, called Enriched dictionary (see below), which allows a much more fine-grained analysis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="methodology-11" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Methodology</h2>
<p>Basically we suggest to examine carefully the full text of documents produced by researchers and extract, in a highly structured and theory-dependent way, information on potential users of research. Users are defined as categories of human agents that share some characteristics that are relevant with respect to the object of interest. In the present context users are social groups, or target groups, that are potentially affected by research results and that use these results for their own purposes. Before entering into a technical description of the methodology let us address the rationale of assuming users as an important dimension of research impact.</p>
<p>There are several compelling theoretical reasons for this choice. First, the literature has strongly underlined the interactive nature of societal research impact. As discussed above, the most recent literature and practice strongly suggest to abandon a unilinear model of impact, in which it is expected that researchers produce results, diffuse them in various channels, and see the results taken up by interested users. Let us call this approach a “percolation model”: researchers produce results that eventually percolate down into society, but without knowing the ways in which they flow, the obstacles they meet, the timing of the process, or the final destination of the flows. On the contrary, it is strongly suggested to adopt an interactive model of interaction, in which researchers actively engage into systematic relation with potential users. In an interactive model there must be a reflexive activity on one side about the nature (characteristics, interests, behavior, style) of the other side. Researchers must build up a representation of their potential users, and vice versa. How could researchers engage with users if they do not know them? And how they could know potential users if they do not engage into some sort of analysis, even as simple as description and characterization? For interaction to take place, there must be some preliminary recognition of the existence, nature, attitudes of those that may utilize the research results. According to our methodological suggestion, it is this representation that is the preliminary object of interest for impact assessment. If researchers have a representation of their potential users, they will leave traces of this representation in their written texts. When they write research proposals they will promise to address the issues of these users, and when they write case studies of research impact they will report on the takeup or use of their research activities by these users.</p>
<p>Second, it has been shown that research activities have a huge variety of impact pathways, largely dependent on the scientific discipline. In turn, this implies that disciplines have at least partially different target groups. Research in political science is different from research in oncology not only because their scientific foundations, methods, objects and cognitive styles are different, but also because they talk to different user groups. The texts produced by researchers themselves are a necessary starting point to reconstruct the various impact pathways. Third, focusing on user groups has the advantage of shifting away the attention from discrete events or products to long term processes of interaction between research and society. The focus on discrete events or products is a typical feature of the narrow definition of research impact cultivated since long time in the so called “valorization of research”. This impact is defined and measured with reference to highly stylized entities, such as patents, licensing contracts, research contracts, and spinoff companies. These are clearly defined, legally enforced, highly visible and measurable entities. Defining and measuring impact is easier by focusing on these entities because they convey the meaning of knowledge transfer from research to the market, and because the final outcome can be defined in monetary terms. We suggest to focus on user groups as a relatively permanent social entity, which is defined by a specific combination of social status, needs, culture, practices and routines. User groups survive the individual personality of people. They are a permanent, although often entirely informal, characterization of society.</p>
<p>Finally, our methodology allows the large scale automatic analysis of large corpora. This means that the inevitable subjectivity in the reconstruction of impact by researchers in writing their proposals and/or impact case studies can be mitigated by examining large scale patterns. It is important to remark that the notion of users is consistent with other suggestions in the literature that adopt different definitions, such as stakeholders, constituencies, interest groups. Our definition is broader and admits more internal variability, as discussed below.</p>
<div id="operationalizing-user-groups-using-natural-language-processing-techniques" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.1</span> Operationalizing user groups using Natural Language Processing techniques</h3>
<p>A simple implication of our methodology is that researchers “leave a trace” of their representation of users, or the groups of social agents that are most likely to use or uptake the results of their research activity. By using state-of-the-art Text mining technologies we are able to identify these traces in written texts and to give them unambiguous meaning. By assuming target groups as units of analysis we suggest to introduce a number of concepts, from which suitable indicators can be derived.</p>
<p><em>Definition 1</em> Stakeholders are entities influenced by the research activity. This definition covers all possible entities that engage an active or passive relation with the research activity.</p>
<p><em>Definition 2</em> Target groups are entities or groups of entities on which researchers claim to have an effect.</p>
<p>Given definition 2, it is clear that every target group is also a stakeholder, while the reverse does not hold true. Non-target stakeholders include the proponents themselves, managing authorities, funding agencies and so on. We need a formal technique for identifying target groups in the text of research documents. This technique as been developed as described in section <a href="patents.html#usersresults">3.1</a>.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are a peculiar type of written text, characterized by authoritativeness, saturation and update. In other words, a dictionary must be composed of entries established by some authority, most often an academic one and/or an authority established since long time by reputation (e.g. editorial initiatives of prestigious publishers). Saturation means that all words that are related to the domain of the dictionary must be included. It is a major flaw of a dictionary the lack of important entries. A dictionary is characterized by a property of semantic saturation: all words that have a meaning associated to a given field are included in the dictionary. Using this tool it will be possible to count the occurrences of target groups, and develop indicators of frequency and intensity. Finally, update means that dictionaries have an internal organization (for example, an editorial board) that examines all new expressions, discusses their acceptability in the dictionary, and make official and authoritative decisions about inclusion or exclusions.</p>
<p>These formal requisites, that used to be appropriate only for established dictionaries, are currently satisfied by a larger variety of sources. In particular, the huge power of Text mining techniques has made it possible to automatize at least some of the steps needed to create a formal dictionary. Section <a href="patents.html#usersresults">3.1</a> illustrates the steps undertaken in order to build up an Enriched dictionary of users. It currently includes 76.857 entries, that have been shown to saturate the semantic field of users. It includes, among others, all jobs, work positions, professions, hobby, patient roles, sports, creative and entertainment roles, political, institutional and organizational roles, social roles, that have been classified in hundreds of official sources. In particular, this includes all stakeholders and target groups, as defined above.</p>
<p>Our Natural Language Processing (NLP) system follows the following steps. - Sentence splitting and Tokenization: this process splits the text into sentences and then segments each sentence in orthographic units called tokens. Sentence splitting plays a key role since thanks to a given word, it is possible to find all sentences in which the word is used. - POS tagging and Lemmatization: The Part-Of-Speech tagging (or POS tagging) is the process of assigning unambiguous grammatical categories to words in a specific context. It plays a key role in NLP and in many language technology systems. Once the computation of the POS-tagged text is completed, the text is lemmatized according to the result of this analysis. - Target groups Annotation: The Target groups Extraction tool is based on lexicon methods. Among the various lexicon methods we adopt, as stated above, the Enriched dictionary approach. With respect to users, we use a lexicon composed of 76.857 entries. By launching this Extraction tool we are able to capture all the different ways in which each target group can be expressed in a research document.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:impact1"><strong>??</strong></a> shows the output of the NLP procedure for a sentence contained in the corpus (“Each year, in England alone, approximately 152,000 people suffer a stroke.”). As it can be seen, the automatic annotation system isolates the only word (“people”) that may be part of a target group.</p>

<div id="from-text-extraction-to-indicators" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> From text extraction to indicators</h2>
<p>After having extracted all possible expression of target groups in research documents, we are in a position to develop indicators with suitable statistical properties. They are defined as follows.</p>
<div id="frequency" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p>For a given document J, let us define T_j (number of target groups contained in J) and W_j (number of words contained in J). We then define:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*} 
F_j= \frac{T_j}{W_j}*100
\end{equation*}\]</span>
<p>The frequency F of a document measures the percentage of words that are target groups. If a document shows high frequency it means that it cites many times target groups, even if it/they are always the same and they are generic. For example, an impact description that repeats many times the target group people will show high frequency.</p>
</div>
<div id="diversity" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>For a given document J, let us define Tu_j (number of different target groups contained in J) and Wu_j (number of different words contained in J). We then define:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*} 
D_j= \frac{Tu_j}{Wu_j}*100
\end{equation*}\]</span>
<p>The diversity D of a document measures the percentage ratio of different words that are target groups. If a document has a high diversity it means that it cites many different target groups, even if they are generic.</p>
</div>
<div id="specificity" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Specificity</h3>
<p>For a given target group i, let us define N (number of document in the corpus) and ni (number of documents that contains the target group i). We then define Si, the specificity of the target group i as:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*} 
S_i= \frac{log(N/n_i)}{log(N)}
\end{equation*}\]</span>
<p>The Specificity of a target group Si measures how rare, and thus specific, is a target group in the overall corpus. The specificity diminishes for target groups that occur very frequently in the corpus and increases for target groups that occur rarely (more specific target group). Let us take the example before, in which the annotation system identifies people as a target group. There will be a large amount of documents in which the word people will occur, so that the ratio between the total number of documents in the corpus and the number of those that include the word people will be close to one. On the contrary, highly specific words (say, free climbers) will occur less frequently, so that the above ratio will increase. Since we are interested in giving a measure for each document, having defined Si for each target group, if the document j contains k different target groups, we have that the specificity of the document j is:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*} 
Sj=\sum_{i=1}^{k}Si,j/k
\end{equation*}\]</span>
<p>The specificity of a document Sj measures how rare, and thus specific, are the target groups contained in that document and it is the mean of the specificity of all the target groups that it contains. If a document contains only rare target group (not cited by other impact descriptions) that document exhibits high specificity. For the previous example, suppose we have a document repeating many times that the research has an impact on people. Since the target group people is a common one (thus having a low specificity Si itself) the measure of the specificity of the document, resulting from the sum of low specificity values, will be low.</p>
<p>An interesting example of application of these principles comes from the scientific study of popular science, or divulgation. In these fields authors use a language which must be understood by lay people, not by professional scientists. For this reason they tend to use generic words, rather than highly specific and professional words. This is, incidentally, one of the reasons why professional scientists often disregard popular science as a literary genre: they perceive the generic nature of language used as too coarse. Scholars of popular science have used quantitative linguistic techniques to distinguish between generic and specific terms in the same semantic field <span class="citation">(Jacobi <a href="#ref-jacobi1999communication">1999</a>)</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.1</span> The meaning of Frequency, Diversity and Specificity indicators for the analysis of research impact</h3>
<p>The above definitions are building blocks of a model of engagement of researchers with their potential users. At the outset, it is important to examine whether researchers include users in their representation of research activity at all. Thanks to the use of an Enriched dictionary, which by definition saturates the semantic field, we are in a position to establish whether user-related expressions are found in researchers’ texts or not. Since in this paper we use the impact case studies produced under the REF, the minimum level is by definition satisfied, as it was the condition for submitting the case study. At the same time, this indicator will be extremely useful for the ex ante evaluation of research proposals. The appropriateness of this indicator and its policy implications will be the object of future research. Authors of the REF documents are by definition aware of the existence of target groups of users.</p>
<p>Once the awareness level is satisfied, frequency comes into play. Frequency is a standard measure in computational linguistics and Text mining techniques, since it gives evidence of the relative importance of words or expressions. The frequency by which target groups are mentioned in a document is a measure of their perceived importance. We are keen to examine the frequency by which users, or target groups, are mentioned in documents produced by researchers. Yet researchers may cite repeatedly a target group, but consider them as a unique entity. This approach is reasonable when the target group does not have internal differentiation (i.e. it is not segmented) and when the results of the research are equally useful for all its members.</p>
<p>But in many relevant cases this undifferentiated approach does not work. Representing and addressing users as a single target group may weaken the potential for impact.</p>
<p>There are two directions in which researchers can deepen their representation of target groups, and hence their impact. One is to address different target groups. This is similar to the notion of segmentation in consumer psychology: if target groups have sufficiently dissimilar characteristics with respect to the activity (in this case, the use of research results), then it is better to treat them differently. The other is to go in depth in addressing each of the target group, by refining their approach, using fine grained representations of the needs of the users. We capture these two directions by measuring diversity and specificity. It is our contention that the language used by researchers is a clear signal of their approach to research impact. A high level of diversity implies that researchers understand the need to mention, identify, enumerate target groups that have different names. They stop using generic words (say, people) and start to introduce some of the many criteria for segmentation. In addition, or in alternative, they discover that within their target groups it is possible to go deep in the fine grained representation, by adding specificity.</p>
<p>A spatial metaphor may help to capture the point: by increasing diversity of target groups researchers move horizontally, defining new regions of the space, while by increasing specificity they move vertically, drilling the ground in each of the regions. Frequency, diversity and specificity are not necessarily correlated. An interesting empirical issue is the relation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>Let us articulate an example. Suppose an expected impact of a given research is on policy making. A low specificity situation arises when researchers speak about “policy makers”, or “government”. A more mature and engaged approach should articulate the policy making process by identifying several specific user groups in addition to the various layers of political and legislative decision making. For example, interest groups. These social actors are extremely important in shaping the policy agenda. A well developed body of research in political theory has examined the way in which new policy issues are generated, framed in the public conversation, and pushed forward in the policy arena until they become established in the policy agenda <span class="citation">(Sabatier <a href="#ref-sabatier1987knowledge">1987</a>)</span>. Pittman <span class="citation">(Pittman <a href="#ref-pittman2006beyond">2006</a>)</span> argues that the most important factors leading to government interest there is the role of domestic advocacy, as well as the interest in their international standing. Second, intermediary organizations or boundary organizations, such as technical agencies and regulatory bodies <span class="citation">(Agrawala, Broad, and Guston <a href="#ref-agrawala2001integrating">2001</a>)</span>. Third, opinion-makers such as think tanks should be included. Many other examples could be added. These actors would be mentioned with more specific expressions.</p>
<p>Finally, researchers may engage into identifying user groups “by name and surname”, that is, as concrete and localized actors with whom they plan to enter into interaction. Counting or measuring them would be the final stage of maturity of research engagement with users.</p>

<div id="description-of-the-corpus" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.4.1</span> Description of the corpus</h3>
<p>The corpus is composed of 6637 REF impact case studies. They generally follow a template illustrated in the REF criteria. The template has a Title and five main text sections, plus the name of the Submitting Institution and the Unit of Assessment. In addition to the Title of the case study, the text sections of the template and the indicative lengths, as recommended in the REF criteria are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Summary of the impact, 100 words</li>
<li>Underpinning research, 500 words</li>
<li>References to the research, 6 references</li>
<li>Details of the impact, 750 words</li>
<li>Sources to corroborate the impact, 10 references</li>
</ol>
<p>We take into consideration the sections Summary of the impact and Details of the impact. It is common practice in computational linguistics to examine the length of documents to be included in a corpus in order to ensure comparability. Figure <a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impacthistogramslength">9.1</a> shows that the limits established by the REF criteria are not always respected. Nevertheless, since the distribution of the length is almost normal and there are not outliers it is appropriate to include all documents in the corpus.</p>

</div>
<p>Within the REF repository projects are classified using three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact type: There are eight Summary Impact Types. These follow the PESTLE convention (Political, Economic, Societal, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) widely used in government policy development, with the addition of Health and Cultural impact types.</li>
<li>Units of assessment (UOA): Institutions were invited to make REF submissions in 36 subject areas, called units of assessment (UOAs), each of which had a separate expert panel.</li>
<li>Research subject areas: The REF Impact case studies are assigned to one or more Research Subject Areas (to a maximum of three) by text analysis of the ‘Underpinning research’ (Section 2 of the Impact case study template). This is a guide to text search that uses a disciplinary structure that is more fine-grained than the one in the 36 Units of assessment.</li>
</ul>

<div id="preliminary-analysis-of-the-corpus" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.4.2</span> Preliminary analysis of the corpus</h3>
<p>In this section we present a descriptive analysis of the content of the documents to give an evidence of two important facts: 1. The description of the impact contains target groups; 2. This information is enough to make a significant statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The corpus contains 8.230.598 words in total and 141.705 different words. By annotating the entire corpus with the entries of the Enriched dictionary we find that the total number of words referring to target groups is 169.037, while the number of different target groups is 1830, or 1.3% of different words.The number of documents that contain at least one target group is 6628, or 99,9% of the total. Only for nine documents we were unable to locate any word referring to a target group.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impactusersdistributions">9.3</a> offers a vivid demonstration of the issue of specificity of words referring to target groups. As many as 37% of all projects include people, and as many as 25% mention company as isolated words. Among the top 20 occurrences we find extremely generic words such as public, community, individual, organization, user, or society. Slightly more specific are the words referring to the school or youth context (child, school, student, teacher) or the health context (patient, patients). In order to find more specific words we have to go further down the ranking. Please note that in all these cases these words do not appear in combination with other that might increase the specificity, but in isolation. Should the same word appear in combination with other more semantically connotated words, they would form a separate target group. As an example, the word people is considered part of a separate expression in the following examples: people with cystic fibrosis, people with primordial dwarfism, people with rheumatoid arthritis, ordinary people in extraordinary situation, people in senior management, people from different background, key policy people in UK government, specific community of people, young people in deprived community in Glasgow. Each of these expressions is considered as a separate target group and their Specificity is computed according to the formula above.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>To see the difference in the use of words in sentences consider the following examples from REF case studies: “The validation of the exit poll forecast allowed people to see the power of social scientific methods, and may have helped them to establish a level of trust in evidence-based information” (generic use of the word people) and “Key components of this are nurturing people with cross-cultural understanding, diversity in thinking and global leadership skills” (more specific use). The NLP procedure developed for this analysis is able to accurately distinguish these situations.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.5.1</span> Descriptive analysis</h3>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:impact2"><strong>??</strong></a> offers a snapshot of the value of indicators calculated across the entire corpus. The minimum value of indicators (zero) is represented by the 9 documents without target groups. On average the REF impact case studies contain words that represent target groups as 2% of total words, and words that represent distinct target groups as 2.5% of different words. In absolute terms, the median REF impact case study contains 10 different words that refers to target groups, repeated 22 times in total.</p>

<p>There is not large variability in the number of different target groups, as the first and third quartile at 7 and 14 are close to the median value. Interestingly, all distributions are close to the normal. A small number of documents use words that refer to target groups with much larger frequency and diversity. The document with maximum use of target groups identifies as many as 34 different words or combination of words. In terms of repetition, the document with the largest number of words uses 115 times a word representing target groups. When coming to specificity, the mean value of 0.659 implies a good level of specificity, given the range of the indicator. Figure <a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impactusersfreqcomparison">9.4</a> shows the distribution of documents by indicators.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.5.2</span> Findings by subject area</h3>
<p>We disaggregate the indicators with respect to the subject areas, or the Units of assessment (UoA), according to the REF nomenclature. This analysis offers a new perspective on the way in which he various disciplines describe their impact pathways. We use the conventional boxplot representation.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impactfrequency">9.5</a> shows a surprising finding. On top of the ranking by frequency of occurrence of words that refer to target groups of users we find Humanities: not only Education (which by nature refers to children, students and teachers as user groups), but also Music and drama, Classics, Language and literature, and History. Or, in other words, disciplines that are not oriented towards users, but rather cultivate the goal of knowledge per se. At the bottom of the ranking we find, again surprisingly, Engineering disciplines, with a number of specializations, and Economics, that is, disciplines that, on the contrary, have a pragmatic orientation towards various target groups of users.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:impactfrequency"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impactdiversity">9.6</a> confirms a similar ranking by subject area when we use the Diversity indicator, with slight variations. In the case of diversity we find also Theology and religious studies, as well as Art and design. Almost all subject areas in Humanities consistently show up at the top when we investigate the frequency by which they mention users of research and the number of different target groups they are able to identify. This is a remarkable finding. It is true that this comes from documents that are themselves retrospective reconstruction of impact, but this feature applies to all subject areas in the same way.</p>
<p>This finding sheds light on one of the controversial issues in the literature on impact evaluation, that is, the role of Humanities and Arts. It seems that one of the tenets of the argument that Humanities and Arts are not sensitive to the audiences, or users, of their research results, is simply false. When asked to reflexively reconstruct their impact, they are systematically able to mention their target groups.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>This comes at a cost, however. Humanities rank top in the Frequency and Diversity of target groups, but rank at the bottom when coming to their Specificity. Figure <a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impactspecificity">9.7</a> shows an almost reverse ranking of subject areas when the indicator chosen is Specificity. At the top of the Specificity ranking we find Social Sciences, such as Economics, Politics, Anthropology and Law. This is another interesting finding. These disciplines have been able to target highly specific groups of users, following a process of academic specialization. They have low Frequency and low Diversity- that is, do not spend much emphasis on their target users, but have high Specificity- that is, they know whom to target.</p>
<p>Large part of Humanities are found at the bottom: Psychology, Education, Philosophy, Language and literature, Art and design. Engineering disciplines are more scattered.</p>
<p>Finally, by combining the three indicators it is possible to examine more closely the pattern of impact of subject areas.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:impactspecificity"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>Frequency and Diversity are highly correlated (<a href="impactresuser.html#fig:impactfrequencydiversity">9.8</a>). Humanities rank top in both indicators and are located in the top right region of the graph. Almost all disciplines in Engineering and Economics and Econometrics lie at the opposite corner. When coming to Specificity, correlation with the other indicators is on the contrary extremely low and is negative (- 0.016 with Intensity, - 0.146 with Diversity).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>The data show an intriguing disciplinary pattern: Humanities and Arts show remarkably higher frequency of terms related to users, but a significantly lower specificity. The opposite is found for many areas of STEM, namely Engineering and several Natural science disciplines.</p>
<p>The results for Humanities are very intriguing. Research in Humanities is often considered as pure, abstract, not engaged with society. This representation is used by those governments that argue that research funding in these areas should be cut because their impact on society cannot be demonstrated. For Social Sciences the situation is slightly different, but there is a presumption that only a few social sciences have an impact, in particular those with instrumental value, such as Economics. Our data tell a different story. When asked to demonstrate the impact of their research, scholars in Humanities and Arts use a very rich vocabulary of users and mention users very frequently, twice as much as scholars in STEM. At the same time, they are less capable to transform their orientation in operational terms, by defining, identifying, targeting specific groups or audiences. At the opposite extreme, it seems that scholars in STEM mention very precise and well defined groups of users. This might be a result of the nature of their studies: researchers in Medicine follow specific targets in terms of disease and patients, or technologists have narrow industrial applications. This remarkable difference may create an imbalance in the assessment of research impact.</p>
<p>Research in STEM finds more easily and unambiguously the groups of potential users, so that its impact is easier to observe and operationalize. As it has been noted by the studies on REF, evaluators may find it easier to use concepts drawn from STEM to evaluate all types of research, simply because they point to more observable and discrete products of research. From the field of social studies of evaluation it is well known that measurements lead to a feedback loop so that the immediate availability of indicators may lead to believe that important things are only those that can be measured.</p>
<p>The notion of impact of research deserves further and intense research effort in the near future. We see several directions of research. First, apply the methodology to ex ante research documents, such as research proposals: do they include users? do they identify target groups with adequate Diversity and/or Specificity? Second, test whether there is a relation between the Specificity of identification of target groups and the assessment of the research, either ex ante (approval of a proposal) and ex post (score obtained in research assessment exercises). Third, extend the methodology to other kinds of documents.</p>
